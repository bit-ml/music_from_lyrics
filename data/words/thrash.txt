Right, right here, I stay...

Stand tall 'til it fades...

Shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
I said, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet 
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, shoot me again, shoot me
Shoot me again, shoot me again
Come on, shoot me again, shoot me again, shoot me

All the shots I take...
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take, I spit back at you, oh-oh-ohh

I won't go away...

Right, right here, I stay...
(With a bullet in my back!)

Shoot me  {Take a shot}

I'm stranded and sold...
(With a bullet in my back!)

No compromise, my heart won't pump the other way

Wake the sleeping giant, wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog, no, let him sleep 
Wake the sleeping giant, wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog, no, let him sleep

I bite my tongue, tryin' not to shoot back

All the shots!  All the shots!
All the shots I take...
Hey, what difference did I make?
Yeah, all the shots I take, spit back at you, oh-oh-ohhDrifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel

Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
GoodbyeNo one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant till I fall

Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away

Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man

Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see, the slaughter never ends

Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away

Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man

Why am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here

Why am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying

Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, moulded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend, alone I clench my gun

Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away

Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man, back to the front

Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the frontUniverse much too big to see
Time and space, never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitation of human understanding

Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive, yeah-h'eah!

(Twisting, turning, through the never)
All that is, ever... Ever was... Will be, ever,
Twisting, turning, through the never!

In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies
Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
On a quest: Meaning... Reason...
Came to be... How it begun

All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun, yeah-h'eah-h'eah!

(Twisting, turning, through the never)
All that is, ever... Ever was... Will be, ever,
Twisting, turning, through the never!

(On through the never)
We must go  (On through the never)
Out to the  (Edge of forever)
We must go  (On through the never)
The never comes!

(Twisting, turning, through the never)
All that is, ever... Ever was... Will be, ever,
Twisting, turning...
Who we are, ask forever
Twisting, turning, through the never!
Never!Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel

Not the word
Not the love
Not what you thought from above

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed!

Find your peace
Find your say
Find the smooth road on your way

Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed!

Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed!

Follow the god that failed!
Broken is the promise
Betrayal, betrayal, yeah!You don't actually care
You don't actually care
Love for you is no beginning
You're not really there
Hallucination

I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination

I understand you think you're above it
The adolescent sense of the sky
The feeling of billowing heartbeats
The fingertips run through your hair

They run through your hair
Hallucination
Hallucination

Oh, you think you're so special
That there's no law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are
We're mere mortals below
Fingertips run through your hair
We are mere mortals below

Are meant to be peons
Are meant to be servants
Are meant to be dismissible objects
One fucks with
One fucks with

Poor pitiful creature

The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every minuscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy

An idiot's idiocy
My, my caring for you
Caring for you
Do you think we're a book
Some kind of a table
You can rest your feet on when you're able
Red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
Poor pitiful creature

To notice the pining
The self deprivation
The self flagellation of you
Dear worshipers
We do like you regal
We do like you haughty
We do love to look upon your perfect body

The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
The taste of your vulva and everything on it
We all really love you
And you have no meaning
You don't even see us
You were never caring

You go do what you do
You do it for you
No one exists with you
You're way above caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Thinking of you
Is another way of dying
Is another way of dying

I'm clawing your chest
Till your collarbone bleeds
Piercing your nipples till I bite them off
I scratch your face and bite your shoulders
Way above caring
Way above caring
And your Kotex jukebox
Your Kotex jukebox

I'm doomed, I'm swearing
Waiting for you
In your high heels and nightie
Your leather dress squeaking
Latex now sweating, waiting for you
In your tincture
Your opium white bathrobe
Your white tiles run red now
Are we both dead now?

The liquid exchange of our heart
The liquid exchange of our heart
Are we both dead now?

You're way above caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring
My caring for you
My caring for you
You're way beyond caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy

My caring for you
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Because thinking of you
Is another way of dying

You're way above caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
You poor pitiful creature
The mistake of feeling
The one who rejects you is the winner
It's true

The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every minuscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
Your heart on your fuckin' sleeve
My caring for you
We were meant to be peons
We're meant to be peons
Mere mortals below
Meant to be servants

Meant to be dismissible objects one fucks with
Oh oh oh, you're so special
No law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are

The fingertips run through your hair
A billowing heart beats
Feeling
Feeling
What a glorious feeling
To be so rejected
So rejected

An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
You think I'm a book or a table
You can rest your fuckin' feet on
When you're able

The taste of your vulva, everything on it
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
We do love you, to look upon your perfect body
We love you regal
We love you haughty
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Caring

Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oblivious to caring

Are we really dead now?
Are we both dead now?The words are cutting deep inside my brain
Thunder burning, quickly burning
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane yeah

Raven black is on my track
He shows me how to neutralize the knife
Show to me in surgery
The art of fighting words to conquer life, conquer life, yeah

Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for
Love me till the end of time, yeah yeah
She make me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mine

I am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime

I've lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child that never was conceived

You gotta believe me
Hey, I'm talking to you

Well, I know, it's hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
More when it's time to die

Don't believe the life you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on, ha ha

Whoa, feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love

Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for

Oh ooh, she makes me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mine
She's all mine, yeah
Yo, yeahNo one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "Rage"

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out againSaid, don't tread on me!

"Liberty or death!",
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke Her:
Rattling of Her tail

Never begins it
Never, but once engaged:
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage!
Said, don't tread on me!

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it!  Settle the score!
Touch me again, for the words that- 
-you will hear ever more:  "Don't tread on me!"

Love it or leave it!
She, with the deadly bite
Quick as the blue tongue,
Forked as a lighting strike

Shining with brightness
Always on surveillance
(Eyes that never close)  Emblem of vigilance!
H'ooh, no-no-no'oh... So don't tread on me!

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it!  Settle the score!
Touch me again, for the words that- 
-you will hear ever more:  "Don't tread on me!"

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war...
"Liberty or death!",
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke Her:
Rattling of Her tail

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it!  Settle the score!
Touch me again, for the words that- 
-you will hear ever more:  "Don't tread on me!"

*(Yes, "Her" is supposed to be capitalized. Do not change.)One crown born to lose
One man does not give a damn
One man, no excuse

Aces wild
Aces high
All the aces
Aces till you die

White lines fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to win

One fist hammers through the mist
One fist, steady on
One heart, die hard from the start
One heart beats its song

Murder all
Murder one
Gimme murder
Second class to none

Headlights fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to win

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
No excuse

Till the end
Been living to win
Been living to winPut dignity to shame, dishonor
Witch hunt, modern day, determining decay
The blatant disarray, disfigure
The public eyes' disgrace, defying common place
Unending paper chase, unending
Deafening, painstaking
Reckoning, this vertigo it doth bring

Shortest straw, challenge liberty
Downed by law, live in infamy
Rub you raw, witch hunt riding through
Shortest straw, this shortest straw has been pulled for you

Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

The accusations fly, discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die, intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you, its teeth and talons through
You're living catch-22, deluding
A mass hysteria, a megalomania
Reveal dementia, reveal
Secretly, silently
Certainly in vertigo you will be

Shortest straw, challenge liberty
Downed by law, live in infamy
Rub you raw, witch hunt riding through
Shortest straw, this shortest straw has been pulled for you

Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

Shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

Behind you, hands are tied, your being, ostracized
Your Hell is multiplied, upending
The fallout has begun, oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none to nothing
You're reaching your nadir, your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear, defending
Channels red, one word said
Blacklisted with vertigo make you dead

Shortest straw, challenge liberty
Downed by law, live in infamy
Rub you raw, witch hunt riding through
Shortest straw, this shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for youI'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"

Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings

"Master, master"

Master, master
Master, master

Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
Promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear and see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"Oh poor twisted me
I feast on sympathy
I chew on suffer
I chew on agony

And swallow whole the pain
Oh it's too good to be
All this misery
Is just for oh poor twisted me
Poor twisted me

Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator, dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

Dear mother, dear father
Time has frozen still, what's left to be
Hear nothing, say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Dear mother, dear father
You clipped my wings before I learnt to fly
Unspoiled, unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do

Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

I'm in Hell without you
Cannot cope without you too
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim, please rescue me

Dear mother, dear father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething, I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite, I feel for you
Living out this Hell you always knew

YouPop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed in the silence

Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless

Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral

Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
A delusion absolution

Perjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Oh, tell the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Burn

Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won't do, that fistful will

Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction

Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction

So light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Oh, no excuse
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Addicted to the
FameCome, won't you stay
Sincere, sincere
All ends in tears

Endure, endure
Thoughts most impure
Concede, concede
But both shall we bleed

Oh, halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell

I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire

Allure, allure
Sweetness obscure
Abide, abide
Secrets inside

Deprive, deprive
To feel so alive
Obey, obey
Just don't turn away

Oh, halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell

I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire

Prayers cannot get through
Return to sender
Unto which of you
Shall I surrender?

Twisting in disguise
Dark resurrection
Lighting up the skies
Wicked perfection

Too dark to sleep, can't slip away
Open or close, my eyes betray
Beyond the black, come, won't you stay?

Hello darkness, say goodbye
Hello darkness, say goodbye
Hello darkness, say goodbyeGrab this life and walk away
War is never done
Rub the patch and battle on
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life
The war that never ends

Leave the battlefield
Yet its horrors never heal
Coming home from war
Pieces don't fit anymore
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life
The war that never ends

Father, please come home
Shell shocked all I've known
Father, please come home

Label him a deadwood soldier now
Cast away and left to roam
Rapid is the road to sacrifice
Just takes longer to come home, come home

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
Crossfire ricochets inside me
Trapped in a memory forever
My life
The war that never endsI know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end

To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity

Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way

Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you

Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight

Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way

See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground

Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way

Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own waySenseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia

Chained and shadowed to be left behind
Nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
Iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metalization of your inner soul
Twisting and turning

Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia

We are as one as we all are the same
Fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
Protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
With our heavy metal

Come let yourself go

Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Eyes tell of morbid tales of his black heart
His deeds through ages past tell of his part

See his face
See his smile
Time to die
Oh, whoa, no

Angel from below, change my dreams
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns

See his face
See his smile
Time to die
Whoa, no, no

I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die

See his face, see his smile
Time to dieCurses rest on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All eternity

Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Hold the pose, feign perception
Grudges break your back

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardized in ruin
What have you become?

Blame the world and blame your maker
Wish 'em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down

Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles
All alone, the fear shall humble
Swallow all your pride

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatine
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead

Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not

Before you judge me take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand

It's not who you are, it's who you know
Others lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and built them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not

(yeah! who the hell are you?)

Holier than thou
You are

It's my world now, it's my world now
It's my world, it's my world

Mama, why's it raining in my room?
Cheer up boy, clouds will move on soon
Heavy fog got me lost inside
I'm gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride

It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world

I'm out my head, out of my head
Get 'em out my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

Who's in charge of my head today?
Dancin' devil's in angel's way

It's my time now, it's my time now
It's my time, yeah it's my time

Look out motherfuckers, here I come
I'm gonna make my head my home
The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead

It's my world, you can't have it

Enough's enoughMoaning at the bed side
Moaning from each limb

Little dog who can't get in
Can only cry but
Can not swim

Pony legs, little trot
Little dog has to wait a lot

The bigger dog has got his spot
And elbowed him away

Listen to him barking
Listen to him call
Little dog don't have much at all

A puny body and a tiny dick
A little dog can make you sick

If you got the money you can go to the top
The female dog don't care what you got
As long as you can raise that
Little dogie face to a cold-hearted pussy
You could have a taste

A taste of what the big dog got
A taste of what the big dog got
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot
Can run his tongue over the hot in trot
Hot in trot
Run his tongue over the hot in trot

Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Tell me what you want

My small dog, he want what I got

Wants to run his tongue over my hot spot

Pathetic little dogDark deception kills the light

Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great old one, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness you dwell

Crawling chaos underground
Cult has summoned twisted sound

Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep has been upset
He awakens, hunter of the shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness you dwell

In madness you dwell

Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons, death may die

Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great old one, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness you dwellWhen I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski
In the dark of the moon

It made me dream of Nosferatu
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau
Oh, wouldn't it be lovely



I was thinking Peter Lorre when things got pretty gory
As I crossed to the Brandenburg Gate

I was feeling snappy, perhaps I'd been napping
And I'd just ate


A following heart can tear you apart
On a midnight to eight shift

A graveyard romance can only give one chance
As the tombstones weave and breathe


Feeling happy when my heart got beating
On a Sunday afternoon

I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses
And stars were still illumined


I have three hearts that I keep apart
Trying to relate
To normal feelings and the nighttime reelings
And some absinthe drunk so late

My small town girl
I'm just a small town girl


The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk
Onto the size of dessert plates

But me I'm happy 'cause I got my little nappy
And some opium to set me straight


I'm just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl
While my looks still hold me straight

Straight up to illusion and fantasy's fusion
Of reality mixed with drink


I'm just a small town girl who's gonna give life a whirl
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate
I'm just a 
Small town girl, she was like a whirl


The Brandenburg Gate
I'm just a small town girl
Small town girl


I'm just a small town girlWeak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery

Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery

Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery

Battery
Battery
BatteryBetter just stay down
You pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the ground
Mouths so full of lies
Tend to block your eyes
Just keep them closed, keep prayin', just keep waitin'

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comes

Push you 'cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself, crawl in yourself, you'll have your time
God, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day, I'll splatter color on this gray

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison

I suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear: The sun will shine
This I swear
This I swear
This I swearTainted misery
Bleed, battle scars
Chemical affinity

Reign, legacy
Innocence corrode
Stain, rot away
Catatonic overload

Choke, asphyxia
Snuff reality
Scorch, kill the light
Incinerate celebrity

Reaper, butchery
Karma amputee
Bloodline redefined
Death contagious deity

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
You burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind
You've reached the end of the line

Time, choke the clock
Steal another day
Die faithfully
Narcissistic fade away

Twisted, jump the rail
Shatter the crowd below
Breaker, chase the ghost
From latest high to all-time low

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
You burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind
You've reached the end of the line

Drop the hourglass of time
Spilling sand we will not find
As we gather here today
We bid farewell
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
Yeah

The slave becomes the master
Need more and more
Right now and ever after
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burned through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind

Dead hourglass of time
Sand we will not ever find
We gather here today
Say goodbye
'Cause you've reached the end of the line

The end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line

You've reached the end of the lineIt looks different, so different than what you see
Projecting judgment on the world
This house is clean baby
This house is clean

Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Look out my window and see it's gone wrong
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector, projector
Rejector, infector, injector, defector, rejector 

I see my reflection in the window
This window clean inside, dirty on the out
I'm looking different than me
This house is clean baby
This house is clean

Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
I look out my window and see it's gone wrong
The court is in session and I slam my gavel down

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector, projector
Rejector, infector, injector, defector, rejector, detector

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector, projector
Rejector, infector, injector, defector, rejector

I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throne
I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throneOil on the wheel
That is blasted and busted away

A nail or a little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
Swarming like bees over the air
Off the pump off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away

Like bees over the air
Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away

Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away

If I pump blood in the sunshine
And you wear a leather box with azaleas
And I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart

As I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin

Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart

If I'm pumping blood
Like a common state worker
If I waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Would you think less of me

And my coagulating heart

Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Coagulating heart
Pumping blood

Would you top me off
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy
While you yell out, "mercy"
We grow apart
Would you rip and cut me

Use a knife on me

Be shocked at the boldness
The coldness of this little heart
Tied up in leather
Would you take the measure
Of the blood that I pump
In the manic confusion of love

Supreme violation
Supreme violation
"Oh, ah, ah, ah Jack I beseech you"

"Oh Jack I beseech you"
Supreme violation

Blood in the foyer
The bathroom
The tea room
The kitchen, with her knives splayed

I will swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick

Blood spurting from me
"Oh Jack, Jack I beseech:"
"Jack, I beseech you, I beseech:"
In the end it was an ordinary heart

"Oh Jack I beseech you"
As I scream out my pain
In the end it was an ordinary heart

In the end, in the end, in the end
It was an ordinary heart

"Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"
Supreme violation . . . Oh

"Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"
I call out your name

Blood in the foyer, the bathroom,
The tea room, the kitchen
And knives splayed
I swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick
Blood spurting from me
Blood spurting from me

"Oh Jack"

"Oh Jack, I beseech ya"
In the end it was an ordinary heart

In the end it was an ordinary heart
Pumping blood.Blacks the light
Blacks the sound
Fear the thought of it never ever coming back
Leave the shift to the round

Death Is Not The End!

Not the End
Not the End
It's the begining

Death is not the end!Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face that learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite

Like a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like conviction, a premonition
Not worthy of, so I deny, I deny

I blind my eyes and try and force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went, almost like your life

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river, drowning, when I only need a drink
Like a poison that I swallow
But I want the world to die

Like a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past, I prayed to leave, from way back then
Like a general without a mission
Until the war will start again, start again

I blind my eyes and try and force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went, almost like your life

Like a touch from Hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from Heaven, turns that key
And brings you straight down to your knees

Like a touch from Hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from Heaven, to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your knees

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went, almost like your life

That was just your lifeCrawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Fear thy name: Extermination
Desecrate, inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still

Fear thy name: Annihilation
Desolate, inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
My apocalypse
Go

Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body, mannequin
Spilling blood, bleeding gas

Mangle flesh, snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass

Split apart
Split apart
Split apart
Spit
Spit it out

What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over?
Born to repeat until I feel

See through the skin, the bones they all rattle
Future and past, they disagree
Flesh falls away, the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me
See the end in me

Claustrophobic
Climb out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Violate, annihilate
All wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate
As life itself denied

Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny inhale the fire

But we've crossed that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Tyrant awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypseMirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave

Like twisted vines that grow
Hide and swallow mansions whole
Dim the light of an already faded primadonna

Faith of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait, something must be done for hundred years

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Now, let my people go, land of Goshen
Go, I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood, running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague, darkness three days long, hail to fire

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first-born man
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first-born man

I rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born, I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Blood, lambs blood painted door, I shall pass

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping deathSaint Anger 'round my neck

He never gets respect

Fuck it all, and no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
I need a voice to let myself, to let myself go free
Fuck it all, and fucking no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
Put down the noose, I'll hang myself
Saint Anger 'round my neck

I feel my world shake like an earthquake
It's hard to see clear: Is it me? Is it fear?

I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you

And I want my anger to be healthy
And I want my anger just for me
And I need my anger not to control

That we should see the light

When reaper calls
May it be
That we walk straight and right

When doubt returns
May it be
That faith shall permeate our scars

When we're seduced
Then may it be
That we not deviate our cause

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

When all is pain
May it be
It's all we've ever known

When flame consumes
May it be
It warms our dying bones

When loss has won
May it be
It's you I'm madly fighting for

When Kingdom comes
May it be
We walk right through that open door

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live, we can live forever

Return to ashes, shed this skin
Beyond the black, we rise again
We shall live foreverYesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the fire

Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, not this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the sky

Unchain the colours before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the fire

Fire
Fire
Fire
FIRE!!Once you have seen it, you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it is heavy and dirty and mean

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know, whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once, so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others, the same song and dance

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath awayTake me with you
Tell me, does your sun still shine?
Come squeeze the world 
Then drip it down my throat again
Down my throat again, oh-whoa

You got to breathe, man, breathe
Coming up for...
Breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for...
Air

Touch me so I think I'm here
Skin my senses
Barely breathing, minus human
Please squeeze the world 
And drip it down my throat again
Ooh, down my throat again

Whoa, oh...
You've got to breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for air
Breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for...
Air

You've got to breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for air
Breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up forAll I want is some special care
On the run from some institution
All I want is some constellation

And I can tell by your face
I'm a total disgrace
Put me inside this place
Move over for a damage case

Hey baby, wait a minute, stop
Don't run away, don't call a cop
I ain't lookin' to victimize you
All I want to do is tantalize you

I can tell by your face
I'm all over the place
I can tell by your face
Got no time for a damage case

No time, baby

Hey babe,don't turn away
I'm here tomorrow, gone today
I don't know what you think your game is
I don't care if even what your name is

And I can tell by this face
You're all over the place
I can tell by your face
Move over for a damage case

Get the fuck over, manHere I go now
Here I go into new days
Hey, hey, hey
Here I go now
Here I go into new days

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah hey hey hey hey hey
Here I go into new days

Hey, hey, hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me
Hey, hey, hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah, hey, hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Hey, hey, hey
And I went
And I went on down that road
Hey, hey, hey
And I went on
And I went on down that road

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
And I went on
And I went on down that road

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear



Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappearConstant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tollsThe window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms, no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
Someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Can't you hear your babies crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still, they try and break me

Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now deservingly this easy chair
But the rocking's stopped by wheels of despair

Don't want your hate
But the fist I've made
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me
While I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Can't you hear your names?
Can't you hear your babies crying?

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try
Mama, they try

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try
Mama, they tryOoh yeah, baby, h'oh-h'oh...
Oh, what was these words right here...
When I get you in my guts...
It makes me play, way too fuckin' good, yeah...

[Battery:]

Lashing out the action - Returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me - Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression - Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery - Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me... Battery... Battery

Crushing all deceivers - Mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me - Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression - Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery - Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me... Battery... Battery

Circle of Destruction - Hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the Battery

You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honey

Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey

If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honey

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb

If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long

If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heart breaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start

And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like hell, the River Styx
Your affection never sticks

No matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honey.If I was half drowning
An arm above the last wave

Would you come to me
Would you pull me up
Would the effort really hurt you
Is it unfair to ask you
To help pull me up

The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating

Pull me up
Would you be my lord and savior
Pull me up by my hair
Now would you kiss me, on my lips

Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening now
Shoots out its tiresome message

Won't you pull me up
Scalding, my dead father
Has the motor and he's driving towards
An island of lost souls

Sunny, a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness
No social redeeming kindness
Or - oh, state of grace

Would you pull me up
Would you drop the mental bullet
Would you pull me by the arm up
Would you still kiss my lips
Hiccup, the dream is over
Get the coffee, turn the lights on
Say hello to junior dad
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
Psychic savagery

The greatest disappointment
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad.Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You...you're smothered in tragedy
And you're out to save the world

Misery!
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery!
There's much more to life than what you see
My Friend Of Misery!

You still stood there screaming!
No-one caring about these words you tell
My friend before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You... you'll take it on all yourself
(Remember), Misery loves company

Misery!
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My Friend Of Misery!

Misery!
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My Friend Of Misery
My Friend Of Misery!

You just stood there screaming, oh
My Friend Of Misery!Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before

Been here before, couldn't say I liked it
Do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?

Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could, I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'

It comes alive
It comes alive
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive	
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Been here before
Been here before

I'm frantic in your soothing arms 
I cannot sleep in this down-filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore

Cross my heart hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon

It comes alive
It comes alive
It comes alive

Takes me awayOoh, no matter where you dwell
You,here again, a captive of the howl
You, welcome back to hell

Faithful as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks angers reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore

Ooh, tooth is fang, twisting under skin
Ooh, foul tongue, black breath
Change, snap inside, the beast about complete
Change, soon infects the rest

Faithful as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks angers reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Howling at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore
Anymore

Ooh,inheritance, the past has bit again
Ooh, the next heir of anarchy
Feel stretching skin so far beyond belief
I feel the ever changing, you, in me

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
Howling evermore
Am I savage?
I don’t recognize me anymore
Anymore

Anymore, ha ha ha
Am I savage?Speak the words I wanna hear to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you

Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining...

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn to stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits
The one who waits for you

Oh, what I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you
(So I dub thee unforgiven....)

Oh, what I've felt...
Oh, what I've known...
I take this key (never free...)
And I bury it (never me...) in you
Because you're unforgiven too

Never free
Never me
'Cause you're unforgiven too

And then produced my rapier

Oh, "Or the Devil, he may take ya."

And it was a pretty penny

Yeah-ehCharging hard and no one's going to give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty

Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct, not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated

Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure

Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated

We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage, Incorporated
Go

Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt

Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy endings on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage, Inc. you see
Step a little closer, if you please

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, IncorporatedNo thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need the feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding
All hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts a-flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse"Suppose," I say...
"You cut some root to make the tree survive."

Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once
I'm, oh, so bored to death!

Ooh, I hunger... I hunger... I eat!

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire,
And run like hell

Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?

"Suppose," I say... "The vultures smile at me."
"Suppose," I say...
"I sent them down and they plan to pick you clean."

And satisfaction, this way, comes
And satisfaction, this way, comes
And satisfaction's here and gone,
Gone, yeah, gone again!

Oh, I hunger... Ooh, I hunger... I eat!

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire,
And stand there

Throw all your bullets in the fire,
And run like hell

On leather steeds, they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen, ride
Or choose your fate and die

'Cause now you've got the fight of your life

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds, they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen, ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeah

Time has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine, your body, it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence, for what you had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death, deliverance, for you, for sure
Now there's nothing you can do

So, gather 'round, young warriors, now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor, blood, guts, and sweat

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

Sleepless, cloaked in despair

Blurring lines of right and wrong

"Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore its done
The brightest flame burns quickest."

A son's heart's sewed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Yeah, still

Rebel, my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what I said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave

So let this heart be still

Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
But a mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
Yeah, I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me, yeah, yeah
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still

Dead gone now

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
There's a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain
I fall 'cause I let go
The net below has rot away
So my eyes seek reality
And my fingers seek my veins

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see 
What I've let me be 
So wicked and worn
So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause Low Man is due

Please forgive me

My eyes seek reality
My fingers feel for faith
Touched clean with a dirty hand
I touch the clean to the waste

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm, yeah
And I can't bear to see 
What I've let me be 
So wicked and worn
So as I write to you, yeah
Of what is done and to do, yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause Low Man is due

Please forgive me
Please forgive me
Please forgive me

So low, the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again
I cry to the alleyway
Confess all to the rain
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror
The one I've broken to match my face

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
Why I've let me be so wicked and wild
So as I write to you, yeah
Of what is done and to do, yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause Low Man is due

Please forgive me
Please forgive me

So low, the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins

(humming)And you will see
Just call my name and I'll be there

You cannot touch me
You would not dare
I am the chill that's in the air

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the day

Dark rivers are flowing
Back into the past
You are the fish for which I cast

And what of the future?
What is to be?
As the rivers flow into the sea

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the day

Do not take for granted
Powers out there
Don't step into the demon's lair

Time is an illusion
Rising from time
Steep is the mountain which we climb

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the dayHave this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

Hard and cold, bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Yeah, are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Yaw, nothing
Oh where's your crown?

Huh!

Wish I may
Wish I might
Have this wish, I wish tonight
I want that star
I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how

Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish you may regret it
Careful what you wish you just might get it

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the King
But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Nothing

No, you're just nothing
Where's your crown King Nothing?
No, you're just nothing
Absolutely nothing
Off to Never-NeverlandOne, two, three, four, five

Spineless from the start
Sucked into the part
Circus comes to town
You play the lead clown

Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Marvel at his tricks
Need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came
Rotting your brain

Chain, chain
Join the endless chain, taken by his glamour
Fame, fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Witchery, weakening
See the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat

Lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lieCrawl out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Ain't no one gonna watch the road
Intention reckless
Ain't no one gonna slow the row
Invention reckless

So I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane

Deadly pulse
Pawing at the wheel
Death Magnetic
Pulling closer still

Ain't no one gonna hold the border
Insanely reckless
Ain't no one gonna give the order
Inanely reckless

So I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane

I scare myself

Crushing metal, Ripping Skin
Tossing body mannequin
Splatter Blood, Bleeding Gas

Mangle flesh, Snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass

What makes me drift a litter bit closer
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over
Dead man takes the steering wheel

See through the skin the bones they all rattle
I start to see the end in me
Flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me

Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Every moment, flashed before my eyes
I wake up SCREAMING
Life is undenied

Ain't no one gonna search the wreckage
Intensely reckless
Ain't no one gonna get the message
Inherently reckless

I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane

Pushing myself in the suicide lane
Daring myself in the suicide lane
Pushing myself in the suicide lane
Daring myself in the suicide laneMotives changing
Day to day
The fire increases
Masks decay

I look at the river
White foam floats down
The body's poisoned
Got to sit tight

The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait

After awakening
The silence grows
The screams subside
Distortion shows

Mutant thoughts
Of bad mouthed news
It's just another birth
Of distorted views

The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait

The wait
The wait
The wait
The waitNo emergency
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face
That learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite

Like a hurt that keeps me focused
Though I think I've gone astray
Like a low grade nightmare that
I must awaken from each day
Like a dream
A beautiful dream
Not worthy of, so I deny...... Yeah

You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
You never open them, so it passed you by
You close your eyes, so you may never fall from grace
You open just in time to say goodbye, oh

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a spring that cannot be in current till
It's time to drink
Like a puzzle
With missing pieces
And the box is thrown away

Like a release from a prison
That you didn't know you're in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed
To leave
From way back then
Like a general
Without a mission
Until the war will start again......

You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
You never open them, so it passed you by
You close your eyes, so you may never fall from grace
You open just in time to say goodbye, oh

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Yeah
Oh, yeah

Oh, yeah

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a touch from heaven on this breeze
That brings you straight down to your knees

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a touch from heaven on this breeze
That brings you straight down to your knees

Oh, yeah

Yeah, yeah

Yeah

Almost like your life

Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life
That was just your lifeThe deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying death pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

The leather armies have prevailed
The phantom lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

Fall to your knees and bow to the phantom lordAll within my hands

Kill, kill, kill, kill, killI've gotta bad reputation
I don't care, I get my share
Don't feel no deprivation

The more I get the better it is
I like it fine, like a little whiz
Treat 'em like ladies, that's a fact
You know the chase is better than the catch

Silver tongued devil, demon leach
You know just what I'm doing
I like a little innocent bitch
You know I ain't just screwing

I love you baby, love you too much
I like you fine I feel your touch
But your appearance don't hold no class
You know the chase is better than the catch

A little beauty I love you madly
Come on home with me
I know you're hot, I know what you've got
You know I want to shake your tree

Come on honey touch me right there
Come on honey don't you get scared
Come on honey let me get you in the sack
You know the chase is better than the catchPlanting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth

Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back what used to be
Drink up, shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain

Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies
Infanticide

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad

Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never Land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never Land
Yeah-heah!

Now I lay me down to sleep

Pray the Lord my soul to keep

If I die before I wake

Pray the Lord my soul to take

And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light

He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath

He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving earth its bleeding
Pure madness alive

And he haunts you
And he binds your soul
And he loathes you
And reclaims it all

You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say

Cthulhu, awaken

He sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyes

Fully loaded Tommy gun

They're gonna put me in a cell
If I can't go to Heaven, let me go to Hell

YeahWhile clutching to what you had thought was real

Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showin' your gratitude
S's'so many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose?

(What the Hell?)  What the Hell?
What is it you think you're gonna' find?

Boredom sets into the boring mind!

(Struggle within!)  It suits you fine!
(Struggle within!)  Your ruin!
(Struggle within!)  You seal your own coffin!
(Struggle within!)  The struggling within!

Home is not a home, it becomes a Hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your Hell

Grabbing for something you've got to feel
(Closing in)  Closing in!
Pressure upon you is so unreal!

I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need

And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay as slave

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will, yeah!

Oh, but I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah!

(And the Earth becomes my throne)
And the Earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one

And my ties are severed clean
Less I have, the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
And you will, yeah!

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah-yeah!

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, that's right!

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere

Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction, feel it burn

Still life incarnation
Still life infamy
Hallucination, heresy
Still you run
What's to come? What's to be?

'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down, all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace

Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down, all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out

(One, two)

Luck runs out

The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide, you hide, but will be found
Release your grip without a sound

Still life, immolation

Into your obsession
Never to return
This is your confession

Hunt you down without mercy

Hunt you down, all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out

Luck runs outEast of Omaha
You listen to the engines
Moanin' out its one song
You think about the woman
Or the girl you knew the night before

But your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're riding sixteen hours
And there's nothing much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was through

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing star again
There I go, turn the page

So you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explode

Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
Other times you can
Oh, the same old clichés
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Make your stand

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing star again
There I go, turn the page

Oh, out there in the spotlight
You're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy
You try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body
Like the music that you play, yeah

Later in the evening
As you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers
Ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Remembering what she said
What she said

Hey

Yeah, and here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on that stage
Here I go, playing star again
There I go, turn the page
There I go, turn that page

There I go, yeah, yeah
There I go, yeah, yeah, yeah
There I go, yeah
Here I go, yeah
There I go, oh
There I go
And I'm goneClose my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes, just to have them close again
Well on my way, but on my way to where I've been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world a nod

Open doors, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes, just to have them close once again
Don't want control as it takes me down and down and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?

The higher you are, the farther you fall
The longer the walk, the farther you crawl
My body, my temple, this temple it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built

The higher you are, the farther you fall
The longer the walk, the farther you crawl
My body, my temple, this temple it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built, yeah

Open doors, as I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take this in

Raised from my grave by the dead

Feel safe, in the danger
Feel good, in the bad

In love with my struggle
In love with my pain
Much needed to keep me down again
Don't allow myself to feel too good
Unworthy of me, couldn't if I could
Feel safe, in the danger
Feel good, in the bad

God! The burning,I've got the speed
Lose your turn, you crash and burn, you walk away

'Cause it ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out

And you crawl back in
Deep in your obsession
Since you've crashed and burned
This is your confession

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs outInsist on playing games
Some waste of time you are
And you're so popular

Well this is it, you bitch
I've got to make my switch
I'm just another john
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
No, too late, too late

I thought you was for real
But you're a rip-off deal
Don't give me all that crap
I just escaped your trap

I think you see the joke
But you're just chasin' smoke
You ain't another one
Know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Hello, too late, too late
Oh

Get on it

Misunderstanding me
The way you feel so free
I'm gonna jump the gun
Oh I'm gonna hit and run

Your credibility
Don't cut no ice with me
Another privilege gone
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh oh, too late, too late
Oh, too late, too lateConstant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tollsRight, right here, I stay...

Stand silent in flames...
Stand tall 'til it fades...

Shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
I said, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet 
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, shoot me again, shoot me
Shoot me again, shoot me again
Come on, shoot me again, shoot me again, shoot me
Shoot me again, shoot me again

Come on!
All the shots I take, I spit back at you
All the shit you fake comes back to haunt you
All the shots! All the shots!
All the shots I take...
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take, I spit back at you, oh-oh-ohh

I won't go away...
(With a bullet in my back!)
Right, right here, I stay...
(With a bullet in my back!)

Shoot me  {Take a shot}
Shoot me  {Take a shot}
Shoot me  {Take a shot}
Shoot me  {Take a shot}

I stand on my own...
(With a bullet in my back!)
I'm stranded and sold...
(With a bullet in my back!)

Shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Yeah, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
I said, shoot me again, shoot me again, come on
Shoot me again, shoot me again

All the shots I take, I spit back at you
All the shit you fake comes back to haunt you
All the shots!  All the shots!
All the shots I take...
Hey, what difference did I make?
All the shots I take, spit back at you, oh-oh-ohh

I bite my tongue, tryin' not to shoot back
No compromise, my heart won't pump the other way

Wake the sleeping giant, wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog, no, let him sleep 
Wake the sleeping giant, wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog, no, let him sleep

I bite my tongue, tryin' not to shoot back

All the shots I take, spit back at you, yea'eh'eh
All the shit you fake comes back to haunt you
All the shots!  All the shots!
All the shots I take...
Hey, what difference did I make?
Yeah, all the shots I take, spit back at you, oh-oh-ohhDrifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel

Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
GoodbyeNo one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant till I fall

Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away

Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man

Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see, the slaughter never ends

Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away

Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man

Why am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here

Why am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying

Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, moulded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend, alone I clench my gun

Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away

Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man, back to the front

Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the frontUniverse much too big to see
Time and space, never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitation of human understanding

Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive, yeah-h'eah!

(Twisting, turning, through the never)
All that is, ever... Ever was... Will be, ever,
Twisting, turning, through the never!

In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies
Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
On a quest: Meaning... Reason...
Came to be... How it begun

All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun, yeah-h'eah-h'eah!

(Twisting, turning, through the never)
All that is, ever... Ever was... Will be, ever,
Twisting, turning, through the never!

(On through the never)
We must go  (On through the never)
Out to the  (Edge of forever)
We must go  (On through the never)
The never comes!

(Twisting, turning, through the never)
All that is, ever... Ever was... Will be, ever,
Twisting, turning...
Who we are, ask forever
Twisting, turning, through the never!
Never!Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel

Not the word
Not the love
Not what you thought from above

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed!

Find your peace
Find your say
Find the smooth road on your way

Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed!

Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed!

Follow the god that failed!
Broken is the promise
Betrayal, betrayal, yeah!You don't actually care
You don't actually care
Love for you is no beginning
You're not really there
Hallucination

I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination

I understand you think you're above it
The adolescent sense of the sky
The feeling of billowing heartbeats
The fingertips run through your hair

They run through your hair
Hallucination
Hallucination

Oh, you think you're so special
That there's no law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are
We're mere mortals below
Fingertips run through your hair
We are mere mortals below

Are meant to be peons
Are meant to be servants
Are meant to be dismissible objects
One fucks with
One fucks with

Poor pitiful creature

The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every minuscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy

An idiot's idiocy
My, my caring for you
Caring for you
Do you think we're a book
Some kind of a table
You can rest your feet on when you're able
Red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
Poor pitiful creature

To notice the pining
The self deprivation
The self flagellation of you
Dear worshipers
We do like you regal
We do like you haughty
We do love to look upon your perfect body

The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
The taste of your vulva and everything on it
We all really love you
And you have no meaning
You don't even see us
You were never caring

You go do what you do
You do it for you
No one exists with you
You're way above caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Thinking of you
Is another way of dying
Is another way of dying

I'm clawing your chest
Till your collarbone bleeds
Piercing your nipples till I bite them off
I scratch your face and bite your shoulders
Way above caring
Way above caring
And your Kotex jukebox
Your Kotex jukebox

I'm doomed, I'm swearing
Waiting for you
In your high heels and nightie
Your leather dress squeaking
Latex now sweating, waiting for you
In your tincture
Your opium white bathrobe
Your white tiles run red now
Are we both dead now?

The liquid exchange of our heart
The liquid exchange of our heart
Are we both dead now?

You're way above caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring
My caring for you
My caring for you
You're way beyond caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy

My caring for you
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Because thinking of you
Is another way of dying

You're way above caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
You poor pitiful creature
The mistake of feeling
The one who rejects you is the winner
It's true

The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every minuscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
Your heart on your fuckin' sleeve
My caring for you
We were meant to be peons
We're meant to be peons
Mere mortals below
Meant to be servants

Meant to be dismissible objects one fucks with
Oh oh oh, you're so special
No law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are

The fingertips run through your hair
A billowing heart beats
Feeling
Feeling
What a glorious feeling
To be so rejected
So rejected

An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
You think I'm a book or a table
You can rest your fuckin' feet on
When you're able

The taste of your vulva, everything on it
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
We do love you, to look upon your perfect body
We love you regal
We love you haughty
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Caring

Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oblivious to caring

Are we really dead now?
Are we both dead now?The words are cutting deep inside my brain
Thunder burning, quickly burning
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane yeah

Raven black is on my track
He shows me how to neutralize the knife
Show to me in surgery
The art of fighting words to conquer life, conquer life, yeah

Now the wicked lance of fear
Is driving from my heady mountain brain
Crash course in brain surgery
Has stopped the bloody knife of words again, yeah yeah yeahWoah oh

Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for
Love me till the end of time, yeah yeah
She make me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mine

I am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime

I've lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child that never was conceived

You gotta believe me
Hey, I'm talking to you

Well, I know, it's hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
More when it's time to die

Don't believe the life you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on, ha ha

Whoa, feel so happy since I met that girl

Oh ooh, she makes me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mine
She's all mine, yeah
Yo, yeahNo one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "Rage"

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out againSaid, don't tread on me!

"Liberty or death!",
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke Her:
Rattling of Her tail

Never begins it
Never, but once engaged:
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage!
Said, don't tread on me!

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it!  Settle the score!
Touch me again, for the words that- 
-you will hear ever more:  "Don't tread on me!"

Love it or leave it!
She, with the deadly bite
Quick as the blue tongue,
Forked as a lighting strike

Shining with brightness
Always on surveillance
(Eyes that never close)  Emblem of vigilance!
H'ooh, no-no-no'oh... So don't tread on me!

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it!  Settle the score!
Touch me again, for the words that- 
-you will hear ever more:  "Don't tread on me!"

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war...
"Liberty or death!",
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke Her:
Rattling of Her tail

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it!  Settle the score!
Touch me again, for the words that- 
-you will hear ever more:  "Don't tread on me!"

*(Yes, "Her" is supposed to be capitalized. Do not change.)One crown born to lose
One man does not give a damn
One man, no excuse

Aces wild
Aces high
All the aces
Aces till you die

White lines fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to win

One fist hammers through the mist
One fist, steady on
One heart, die hard from the start
One heart beats its song

Murder all
Murder one
Gimme murder
Second class to none

Headlights fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to win

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
No excuse

Till the end
Been living to win
Been living to winPut dignity to shame, dishonor
Witch hunt, modern day, determining decay
The blatant disarray, disfigure
The public eyes' disgrace, defying common place
Unending paper chase, unending
Deafening, painstaking
Reckoning, this vertigo it doth bring

Shortest straw, challenge liberty
Downed by law, live in infamy
Rub you raw, witch hunt riding through
Shortest straw, this shortest straw has been pulled for you

Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

The accusations fly, discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die, intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you, its teeth and talons through
You're living catch-22, deluding
A mass hysteria, a megalomania
Reveal dementia, reveal
Secretly, silently
Certainly in vertigo you will be

Shortest straw, challenge liberty
Downed by law, live in infamy
Rub you raw, witch hunt riding through
Shortest straw, this shortest straw has been pulled for you

Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

Shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

Behind you, hands are tied, your being, ostracized
Your Hell is multiplied, upending
The fallout has begun, oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none to nothing
You're reaching your nadir, your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear, defending
Channels red, one word said
Blacklisted with vertigo make you dead

Shortest straw, challenge liberty
Downed by law, live in infamy
Rub you raw, witch hunt riding through
Shortest straw, this shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for youI'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"

Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"

Master, master
Master, master

Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
Promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear and see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"Oh poor twisted me
I feast on sympathy
I chew on suffer
I chew on agony

And swallow whole the pain
Oh it's too good to be
All this misery
Is just for oh poor twisted me
Poor twisted me

Ooh yeah
Poor twisted me

Poor mistreated me
Poor mistreated me
I drown without a sea
I'm filled with sorrow
Once filled with misery

And hated the deep dark blue
Oh woe is me
Such a burden to bear
Poor mistreated me, yeah

Finally reached the shore
I survived the storm
Now you're feeling cold ever since he was born
Your pain is so over you

Finally reached the shore

Now you're feeling cold ever since he was born
No more

Your pain is so over you
Could ya be my friend?
Such a burden to see
Oh poor twisted me

Save ourselves before the earth bleeds

He takes in his medicine

Believer, deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life

Dear mother, dear father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator, dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

Dear mother, dear father
Time has frozen still, what's left to be
Hear nothing, say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Dear mother, dear father
You clipped my wings before I learnt to fly
Unspoiled, unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do

Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

I'm in Hell without you
Cannot cope without you too
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim, please rescue me

Dear mother, dear father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething, I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite, I feel for you
Living out this Hell you always knew

YouPop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed in the silence

Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless

Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral

Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
A delusion absolution

Perjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Oh, tell the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Burn

Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won't do, that fistful will

Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction

Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction

So light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Oh, no excuse
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Addicted to the
FameCome, won't you stay
Sincere, sincere
All ends in tears

Endure, endure
Thoughts most impure
Concede, concede
But both shall we bleed

Oh, halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell

I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire

Allure, allure
Sweetness obscure
Abide, abide
Secrets inside

Deprive, deprive
To feel so alive
Obey, obey
Just don't turn away

Oh, halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell

I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire

Prayers cannot get through
Return to sender
Unto which of you
Shall I surrender?

Twisting in disguise
Dark resurrection
Lighting up the skies
Wicked perfection

Too dark to sleep, can't slip away
Open or close, my eyes betray
Beyond the black, come, won't you stay?

Hello darkness, say goodbye
Hello darkness, say goodbye
Hello darkness, say goodbyeGrab this life and walk away
War is never done
Rub the patch and battle on
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life
The war that never ends

Leave the battlefield
Yet its horrors never heal
Coming home from war
Pieces don't fit anymore
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life
The war that never ends

Father, please come home
Shell shocked all I've known
Father, please come home

Label him a deadwood soldier now
Cast away and left to roam
Rapid is the road to sacrifice
Just takes longer to come home, come home

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
Crossfire ricochets inside me
Trapped in a memory forever
My life
The war that never endsI know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end

To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity

Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way

Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you

Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight

Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way

See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground

Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way

Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own waySenseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia

Chained and shadowed to be left behind
Nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
Iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metalization of your inner soul
Twisting and turning

Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia

We are as one as we all are the same
Fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
Protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world

Eyes tell of morbid tales of his black heart
His deeds through ages past tell of his part

See his face
See his smile
Time to die
Oh, whoa, no

Angel from below, change my dreams
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns

See his face
See his smile
Time to die
Whoa, no, no

I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die

See his face, see his smile
Time to dieCurses rest on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All eternity

Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Hold the pose, feign perception
Grudges break your back

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardized in ruin
What have you become?

Blame the world and blame your maker
Wish 'em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down

Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles
All alone, the fear shall humble
Swallow all your pride

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatine
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead

Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not

Before you judge me take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand

It's not who you are, it's who you know
Others lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and built them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not

(yeah! who the hell are you?)

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou

It's my world now, it's my world now
It's my world, it's my world

Mama, why's it raining in my room?
Cheer up boy, clouds will move on soon
Heavy fog got me lost inside
I'm gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride

It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world

I'm out my head, out of my head
Get 'em out my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

Who's in charge of my head today?
Dancin' devil's in angel's way

It's my time now, it's my time now
It's my time, yeah it's my time

Look out motherfuckers, here I come
I'm gonna make my head my home
The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead

It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world

I don't even know what the question is
Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is

God it feels like it only rains on me

Enough's enoughMoaning at the bed side
Moaning from each limb

Little dog who can't get in
Can only cry but
Can not swim

Pony legs, little trot
Little dog has to wait a lot

The bigger dog has got his spot
And elbowed him away

Listen to him barking
Listen to him call
Little dog don't have much at all

A puny body and a tiny dick
A little dog can make you sick

If you got the money you can go to the top
The female dog don't care what you got
As long as you can raise that
Little dogie face to a cold-hearted pussy
You could have a taste

A taste of what the big dog got
A taste of what the big dog got
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot
Can run his tongue over the hot in trot
Hot in trot
Run his tongue over the hot in trot

Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Tell me what you want

My small dog, he want what I got

Wants to run his tongue over my hot spot

Pathetic little dogDark deception kills the light

Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great old one, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness you dwell

Crawling chaos underground
Cult has summoned twisted sound

Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep has been upset
He awakens, hunter of the shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness you dwell

In madness you dwell

Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons, death may die

Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great old one, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness you dwellWhen I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski
In the dark of the moon

It made me dream of Nosferatu
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau
Oh, wouldn't it be lovely



I was thinking Peter Lorre when things got pretty gory
As I crossed to the Brandenburg Gate

I was feeling snappy, perhaps I'd been napping
And I'd just ate


A following heart can tear you apart
On a midnight to eight shift

A graveyard romance can only give one chance
As the tombstones weave and breathe


Feeling happy when my heart got beating
On a Sunday afternoon

I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses
And stars were still illumined


I have three hearts that I keep apart
Trying to relate
To normal feelings and the nighttime reelings
And some absinthe drunk so late

My small town girl
I'm just a small town girl


The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk
Onto the size of dessert plates

But me I'm happy 'cause I got my little nappy
And some opium to set me straight


I'm just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl
While my looks still hold me straight

Straight up to illusion and fantasy's fusion
Of reality mixed with drink


I'm just a small town girl who's gonna give life a whirl
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate
I'm just a 
Small town girl, she was like a whirl


The Brandenburg Gate
I'm just a small town girl
Small town girl


I'm just a small town girlWeak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery

Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery

Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery

Battery
Battery
BatteryBetter just stay down
You pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the ground
Mouths so full of lies
Tend to block your eyes
Just keep them closed, keep prayin', just keep waitin'

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comes

Push you 'cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself, crawl in yourself, you'll have your time
God, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day, I'll splatter color on this gray

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison

I suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear: The sun will shine
This I swear
This I swear
This I swearTainted misery
Bleed, battle scars
Chemical affinity

Reign, legacy
Innocence corrode
Stain, rot away
Catatonic overload

Choke, asphyxia
Snuff reality
Scorch, kill the light
Incinerate celebrity

Reaper, butchery
Karma amputee
Bloodline redefined
Death contagious deity

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
You burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind
You've reached the end of the line

Time, choke the clock
Steal another day
Die faithfully
Narcissistic fade away

Twisted, jump the rail
Shatter the crowd below
Breaker, chase the ghost
From latest high to all-time low

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
You burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind
You've reached the end of the line

Drop the hourglass of time
Spilling sand we will not find
As we gather here today
We bid farewell
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
Yeah

The slave becomes the master
Need more and more
Right now and ever after
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burned through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind

Dead hourglass of time
Sand we will not ever find
We gather here today
Say goodbye
'Cause you've reached the end of the line

The end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line

You've reached the end of the lineIt looks different, so different than what you see
Projecting judgment on the world
This house is clean baby
This house is clean

Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Look out my window and see it's gone wrong
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector, projector
Rejector, infector, injector, defector, rejector 

I see my reflection in the window
This window clean inside, dirty on the out
I'm looking different than me
This house is clean baby
This house is clean

Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
I look out my window and see it's gone wrong
The court is in session and I slam my gavel down

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector, projector
Rejector, infector, injector, defector, rejector, detector

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector, projector
Rejector, infector, injector, defector, rejector

I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throne
I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throneOil on the wheel
That is blasted and busted away

A nail or a little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
Swarming like bees over the air
Off the pump off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away

Like bees over the air
Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away

Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away

If I pump blood in the sunshine
And you wear a leather box with azaleas
And I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart

As I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin

Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart

If I'm pumping blood
Like a common state worker
If I waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Would you think less of me

And my coagulating heart

Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Coagulating heart
Pumping blood

Would you top me off
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy
While you yell out, "mercy"
We grow apart
Would you rip and cut me

Use a knife on me

Be shocked at the boldness
The coldness of this little heart
Tied up in leather
Would you take the measure
Of the blood that I pump
In the manic confusion of love

Supreme violation
Supreme violation
"Oh, ah, ah, ah Jack I beseech you"

"Oh Jack I beseech you"
Supreme violation

Blood in the foyer
The bathroom
The tea room
The kitchen, with her knives splayed

I will swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick

Blood spurting from me
"Oh Jack, Jack I beseech:"
"Jack, I beseech you, I beseech:"
In the end it was an ordinary heart

"Oh Jack I beseech you"
As I scream out my pain
In the end it was an ordinary heart

In the end, in the end, in the end
It was an ordinary heart

"Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"
Supreme violation . . . Oh

"Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"
I call out your name

Blood in the foyer, the bathroom,
The tea room, the kitchen
And knives splayed
I swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick
Blood spurting from me
Blood spurting from me

"Oh Jack"

"Oh Jack, I beseech ya"
In the end it was an ordinary heart

In the end it was an ordinary heart
Pumping blood.Blacks the light
Blacks the sound
Fear the thought of it never ever coming back
Leave the shift to the round


Open up your gate
Spirits I elate
Watch the falling sand
Shifting through his hand
Open Up Your Gate
Spirits I elate
Whisper To Your Friends
Death Is Not The End!

Not the End
Not the End
It's the beginning
It's a…

Paid my dues in the cell
Be the toll of the bell

Spirits I elate
Watch the falling sand
Slipping through his hand
Open Up Your Gate
Spirits I elate
Whisper To Your Friends
Death Is Not The End!

Not the End
Not the End
It's the begining

Death is not the end!Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face that learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite

Like a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like conviction, a premonition
Not worthy of, so I deny, I deny

I blind my eyes and try and force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went, almost like your life

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river, drowning, when I only need a drink
Like a poison that I swallow
But I want the world to die

Like a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past, I prayed to leave, from way back then
Like a general without a mission
Until the war will start again, start again

I blind my eyes and try and force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went, almost like your life

Like a touch from Hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from Heaven, turns that key
And brings you straight down to your knees

Like a touch from Hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from Heaven, to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your knees

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went, almost like your life

That was just your lifeCrawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Fear thy name: Extermination
Desecrate, inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still

Fear thy name: Annihilation
Desolate, inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
My apocalypse
Go

Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body, mannequin
Spilling blood, bleeding gas

Mangle flesh, snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass

Split apart
Split apart
Split apart
Spit
Spit it out

What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over?
Born to repeat until I feel

See through the skin, the bones they all rattle
Future and past, they disagree
Flesh falls away, the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me
See the end in me

Claustrophobic
Climb out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Violate, annihilate
All wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate
As life itself denied

Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny inhale the fire

But we've crossed that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Tyrant awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypseMirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd cry the nowhere tears of honor
Like twisted vines that grow
Hide and swallow mansions whole
Dim the light of an already faded primadonna

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun sets behind your back
And can't the band play on?
Just listen, they play my song
Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune, fame

Faith of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait, something must be done for hundred years

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Now, let my people go, land of Goshen
Go, I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood, running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague, darkness three days long, hail to fire

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first-born man
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first-born man

I rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born, I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Blood, lambs blood painted door, I shall pass

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping deathSaint Anger 'round my neck

Fuck it all, and no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
I need a voice to let myself, to let myself go free
Fuck it all, and fucking no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
Put down the noose, I'll hang myself
Saint Anger 'round my neck

I feel my world shake like an earthquake
It's hard to see clear: Is it me? Is it fear?

I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you

That we should see the light

When reaper calls
May it be
That we walk straight and right

When doubt returns
May it be
That faith shall permeate our scars

When we're seduced
Then may it be
That we not deviate our cause

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

When all is pain
May it be
It's all we've ever known

When flame consumes
May it be
It warms our dying bones

When loss has won
May it be
It's you I'm madly fighting for

When Kingdom comes
May it be
We walk right through that open door

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live, we can live forever

Return to ashes, shed this skin
Beyond the black, we rise again
We shall live foreverYesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the fire

Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, not this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the sky

Unchain the colours before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the fire

Fire
Fire
Fire
FIRE!!Once you have seen it, you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it is heavy and dirty and mean

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know, whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once, so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others, the same song and dance

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath awayTake me with you
Tell me, does your sun still shine?
Come squeeze the world 
Then drip it down my throat again
Down my throat again, oh-whoa

You got to breathe, man, breathe
Coming up for...
Breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for...
Air

Touch me so I think I'm here
Skin my senses
Barely breathing, minus human
Please squeeze the world 
And drip it down my throat again
Ooh, down my throat again

Whoa, oh...
You've got to breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for air
Breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for...
Air

You've got to breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for air
Breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up forAll I want is some special care
On the run from some institution
All I want is some constellation

And I can tell by your face
I'm a total disgrace
Put me inside this place
Move over for a damage case

Hey baby, wait a minute, stop
Don't run away, don't call a cop
I ain't lookin' to victimize you
All I want to do is tantalize you

I can tell by your face
I'm all over the place
I can tell by your face
Got no time for a damage case

No time, baby

Hey babe,don't turn away
I'm here tomorrow, gone today
I don't know what you think your game is
I don't care if even what your name is

And I can tell by this face
You're all over the place
I can tell by your face
Move over for a damage case

Get the fuck over, manHere I go now
Here I go into new days
Hey, hey, hey
Here I go now
Here I go into new days

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah hey hey hey hey hey
Here I go into new days

Hey, hey, hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me
Hey, hey, hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah, hey, hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Hey, hey, hey
And I went
And I went on down that road
Hey, hey, hey
And I went on
And I went on down that road

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappearConstant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tollsThe window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms, no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
Someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Can't you hear your babies crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still, they try and break me

Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now deservingly this easy chair
But the rocking's stopped by wheels of despair

Don't want your hate
But the fist I've made
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me
While I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Can't you hear your names?
Can't you hear your babies crying?

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try
Mama, they try

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try
Mama, they tryOoh yeah, baby, h'oh-h'oh...
Oh, what was these words right here...
When I get you in my guts...
It makes me play, way too fuckin' good, yeah...

[Battery:]

Lashing out the action - Returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me - Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression - Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery - Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me... Battery... Battery

Crushing all deceivers - Mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me - Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression - Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery - Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me... Battery... Battery

Circle of Destruction - Hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the Battery

Smashing through the boundaries

Holding the lion's share, holding the key
Holding me back 'cause I'm striving to be

Better than youIf the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honey

Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey

If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honey

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb

If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long

If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heart breaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start

And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like hell, the River Styx
Your affection never sticks

No matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honey.If I was half drowning
An arm above the last wave

Would you come to me
Would you pull me up
Would the effort really hurt you
Is it unfair to ask you
To help pull me up

The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating

Pull me up
Would you be my lord and savior
Pull me up by my hair
Now would you kiss me, on my lips

Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening now
Shoots out its tiresome message

Won't you pull me up
Scalding, my dead father
Has the motor and he's driving towards
An island of lost souls

Sunny, a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness
No social redeeming kindness
Or - oh, state of grace

Would you pull me up
Would you drop the mental bullet
Would you pull me by the arm up
Would you still kiss my lips
Hiccup, the dream is over
Get the coffee, turn the lights on
Say hello to junior dad
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
Psychic savagery

The greatest disappointment
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad.Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You...you're smothered in tragedy
And you're out to save the world

Misery!
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery!
There's much more to life than what you see
My Friend Of Misery!

You still stood there screaming!
No-one caring about these words you tell
My friend before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You... you'll take it on all yourself
(Remember), Misery loves company

Misery!
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My Friend Of Misery!

Misery!
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My Friend Of Misery
My Friend Of Misery!

You just stood there screaming, oh
My Friend Of Misery!Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before

Been here before, couldn't say I liked it
Do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?

Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could, I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'

It comes alive
It comes alive
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive	
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Been here before
Been here before

I'm frantic in your soothing arms 
I cannot sleep in this down-filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore

Cross my heart hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon

It comes alive
It comes alive
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive	
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive	
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Get the fuck out of here
I just wanna get the fuck away from me
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I hate it all, why? Why? Why me?

I cannot sleep with a head like this
I wanna cry, I wanna scream
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I wanna hate it all away

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive	
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
Yeah, takes me away

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me awayOoh, no matter where you dwell
You,here again, a captive of the howl
You, welcome back to hell

Faithful as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks angers reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore

Ooh, tooth is fang, twisting under skin
Ooh, foul tongue, black breath
Change, snap inside, the beast about complete
Change, soon infects the rest

Faithful as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks angers reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Howling at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore
Anymore

Ooh,inheritance, the past has bit again
Ooh, the next heir of anarchy
Feel stretching skin so far beyond belief
I feel the ever changing, you, in me

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
Howling evermore
Am I savage?
I don’t recognize me anymore
Anymore

Anymore, ha ha ha
Am I savage?Speak the words I wanna hear to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you

Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining...

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn to stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits
The one who waits for you

Oh, what I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you
(So I dub thee unforgiven....)

Oh, what I've felt...
Oh, what I've known...
I take this key (never free...)
And I bury it (never me...) in you
Because you're unforgiven too

Never free
Never me
'Cause you're unforgiven too
OhThe Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell
And his money he was countin'

I first produced my pistol
And then produced my rapier
I said, "Stand and deliver."
Oh, "Or the Devil, he may take ya."

Yeah

I took all of his money
And it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money

Yeah-ehCharging hard and no one's going to give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty

Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct, not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated

Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure

Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated

We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage, Incorporated
Go

Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt

Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy endings on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage, Inc. you see
Step a little closer, if you please

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, IncorporatedNo thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need the feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding
All hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts a-flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse"Suppose," I say...
"You cut some root to make the tree survive."

Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once
I'm, oh, so bored to death!

Ooh, I hunger... I hunger... I eat!

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire,
And run like hell

Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?

"Suppose," I say... "The vultures smile at me."
"Suppose," I say...
"I sent them down and they plan to pick you clean."

And satisfaction, this way, comes
And satisfaction, this way, comes
And satisfaction's here and gone,
Gone, yeah, gone again!

Oh, I hunger... Ooh, I hunger... I eat!

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel

The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children, now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you've got some company

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds, they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen, ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeah

You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it's all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once, a sinner twice
No need for confessions now
'Cause now you've got the fight of your life

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds, they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen, ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeah

Time has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine, your body, it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence, for what you had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death, deliverance, for you, for sure
Now there's nothing you can do

So, gather 'round, young warriors, now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor, blood, guts, and sweat

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

Sleepless, cloaked in despair
I'm behind you

Blurring lines of right and wrong
Far too late for frail amends

Desperate hands that lose control
Have no mercy on your soul
On your soul

"Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore its done
The brightest flame burns quickest."
That's what I heard her say
A son's heart's sewed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Yeah, still

Rebel, my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what I said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave

So let this heart be still

Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
But a mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
Yeah, I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me, yeah, yeah
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Oh-whoa

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave

So let this heart be stillThese are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the Kingdom of Salvation take me home?And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you

Ain't gonna waste my hate
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself

Ain't gonna give no more

I think it's time you pleased yourself
Yourself

And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Hate

You think you're worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?

I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell's my mind going now?
Dead gone now

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
There's a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain
I fall 'cause I let go
The net below has rot away
So my eyes seek reality
And my fingers seek my veins

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see 
What I've let me be 
So wicked and worn
So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause Low Man is due

Please forgive me

My eyes seek reality
My fingers feel for faith
Touched clean with a dirty hand
I touch the clean to the waste

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm, yeah
And I can't bear to see 
What I've let me be 
So wicked and worn
So as I write to you, yeah
Of what is done and to do, yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause Low Man is due

Please forgive me
Please forgive me
Please forgive me

So low, the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again
I cry to the alleyway
Confess all to the rain
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror
The one I've broken to match my face

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
Why I've let me be so wicked and wild
So as I write to you, yeah
Of what is done and to do, yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause Low Man is due

Please forgive me
Please forgive me

So low, the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins

(humming)And you will see
Just call my name and I'll be there

You cannot touch me
You would not dare
I am the chill that's in the air

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the day

Dark rivers are flowing
Back into the past
You are the fish for which I cast

And what of the future?
What is to be?
As the rivers flow into the sea

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the day

Do not take for granted
Powers out there
Don't step into the demon's lair

Time is an illusion
Rising from time
Steep is the mountain which we climb

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the dayHave this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

Hard and cold, bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Yeah, are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Yaw, nothing
Oh where's your crown?

Huh!

Wish I may
Wish I might
Have this wish, I wish tonight
I want that star
I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how

Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish you may regret it
Careful what you wish you just might get it

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the King
But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Nothing

No, you're just nothing
Where's your crown King Nothing?
No, you're just nothing
Absolutely nothing
Off to Never-NeverlandOne, two, three, four, five

Spineless from the start
Sucked into the part
Circus comes to town
You play the lead clown

Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Marvel at his tricks
Need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came
Rotting your brain

Chain, chain
Join the endless chain, taken by his glamour
Fame, fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Witchery, weakening
See the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat

Lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lieCrawl out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Ain't no one gonna watch the road
Intention reckless
Ain't no one gonna slow the row
Invention reckless

So I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane

Deadly pulse
Pawing at the wheel
Death Magnetic
Pulling closer still

Ain't no one gonna hold the border
Insanely reckless
Ain't no one gonna give the order
Inanely reckless

So I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane

I scare myself

Crushing metal, Ripping Skin
Tossing body mannequin
Splatter Blood, Bleeding Gas

Mangle flesh, Snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass

What makes me drift a litter bit closer
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over
Dead man takes the steering wheel

See through the skin the bones they all rattle
I start to see the end in me
Flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me

Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Every moment, flashed before my eyes
I wake up SCREAMING
Life is undenied

Ain't no one gonna search the wreckage
Intensely reckless
Ain't no one gonna get the message
Inherently reckless

I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane

Pushing myself in the suicide lane
Daring myself in the suicide lane
Pushing myself in the suicide lane
Daring myself in the suicide laneMotives changing
Day to day
The fire increases
Masks decay

I look at the river
White foam floats down
The body's poisoned
Got to sit tight

The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait

After awakening
The silence grows
The screams subside
Distortion shows

Mutant thoughts
Of bad mouthed news
It's just another birth
Of distorted views

The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait

The wait
The wait
The wait
The waitNo emergency
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face
That learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite

Like a hurt that keeps me focused
Though I think I've gone astray
Like a low grade nightmare that
I must awaken from each day
Like a dream
A beautiful dream
Not worthy of, so I deny...... Yeah

You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
You never open them, so it passed you by
You close your eyes, so you may never fall from grace
You open just in time to say goodbye, oh

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a spring that cannot be in current till
It's time to drink
Like a puzzle
With missing pieces
And the box is thrown away

Like a release from a prison
That you didn't know you're in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed
To leave
From way back then
Like a general
Without a mission
Until the war will start again......

You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
You never open them, so it passed you by
You close your eyes, so you may never fall from grace
You open just in time to say goodbye, oh

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Yeah
Oh, yeah

Oh, yeah

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a touch from heaven on this breeze
That brings you straight down to your knees

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught

Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight

Almost like your life
That was just your lifeThe deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying death pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

The leather armies have prevailed
The phantom lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

Fall to your knees and bow to the phantom lordAll within my hands

Kill, kill, kill, kill, killI've gotta bad reputation
I don't care, I get my share
Don't feel no deprivation

The more I get the better it is
I like it fine, like a little whiz
Treat 'em like ladies, that's a fact
You know the chase is better than the catch

Silver tongued devil, demon leach
You know just what I'm doing
I like a little innocent bitch
You know I ain't just screwing

I love you baby, love you too much
I like you fine I feel your touch
But your appearance don't hold no class
You know the chase is better than the catch

A little beauty I love you madly
Come on home with me
I know you're hot, I know what you've got
You know I want to shake your tree

Come on honey touch me right there
Come on honey don't you get scared
Come on honey let me get you in the sack
You know the chase is better than the catchPlanting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth

Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back what used to be
Drink up, shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain

Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies
Infanticide

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad

Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never Land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never Land
Yeah-heah!

Now I lay me down to sleep

Pray the Lord my soul to keep

If I die before I wake

Pray the Lord my soul to take

And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night

He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath

He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving earth its bleeding
Pure madness alive

And he haunts you
And he binds your soul
And he loathes you
And reclaims it all

You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say

Cthulhu, awaken

He sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyes

Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

Fully loaded Tommy gun

They're gonna put me in a cell
If I can't go to Heaven, let me go to Hell

YeahWhile clutching to what you had thought was real

Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showin' your gratitude
S's'so many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose?

(What the Hell?)  What the Hell?
What is it you think you're gonna' find?

(Struggle within!)  It suits you fine!
(Struggle within!)  Your ruin!
(Struggle within!)  You seal your own coffin!
(Struggle within!)  The struggling within!

Home is not a home, it becomes a Hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your Hell

Grabbing for something you've got to feel
(Closing in)  Closing in!
Pressure upon you is so unreal!

I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need

And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay as slave

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will, yeah!

Oh, but I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah!

(And the Earth becomes my throne)
And the Earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one

And my ties are severed clean
Less I have, the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
And you will, yeah!

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah-yeah!

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, that's right!

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere

You listen to the engines
Moanin' out its one song
You think about the woman
Or the girl you knew the night before

But your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're riding sixteen hours
And there's nothing much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was through

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing star again
There I go, turn the page

So you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explode

Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
Other times you can
Oh, the same old clichés
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Make your stand

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing star again
There I go, turn the page

Oh, out there in the spotlight
You're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy
You try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body
Like the music that you play, yeah

Later in the evening
As you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers
Ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Remembering what she said
What she said

Hey

Yeah, and here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on that stage
Here I go, playing star again
There I go, turn the page
There I go, turn that page

And I'm goneClose my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes, just to have them close again
Well on my way, but on my way to where I've been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world a nod

Open doors, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes, just to have them close once again
Don't want control as it takes me down and down and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?

The higher you are, the farther you fall
The longer the walk, the farther you crawl

And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral

YeahCrawling from the wreckage one more time
This map is tattered, can't read the signs
Though the body's rusted
Isn't hard to turn
On the path of destruction, feel it burn
Feel safe, in the danger
Feel good, in the bad

God! The burning,I've got the speed
Lose your turn, you crash and burn, you walk away

'Cause it ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out

Luck (luck,luck), Runs (runs,runs), Out (out,out)
In love with my struggle
In love with my pain
Much needed to keep me down again
Don't allow myself to feel too good
Unworthy of me, couldn't if I could
Feel safe, in the danger
Feel good, in the bad

God! The burning,I've got the speed
Lose your turn, you crash and burn, you walk away

'Cause it ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out

And you crawl back in
Deep in your obsession
Since you've crashed and burned
This is your confession

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs outInsist on playing games
Some waste of time you are
And you're so popular

Well this is it, you bitch
I've got to make my switch
I'm just another john
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
No, too late, too late

I thought you was for real
But you're a rip-off deal
Don't give me all that crap
I just escaped your trap

I think you see the joke
But you're just chasin' smoke
You ain't another one
Know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Hello, too late, too late
Oh

Get on it

Misunderstanding me
The way you feel so free
I'm gonna jump the gun
Oh I'm gonna hit and run

Your credibility
Don't cut no ice with me
Another privilege gone
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh oh, too late, too late
Oh, too late, too lateConstant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tollsCan't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops with me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Now the world is gone I'm just one
Oh God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me

Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hellWe do our best, you're the rest, you make it real, you know
There's a feeling deep inside that drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead, you need it oh so bad

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!

Bang your head against the stage like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore
In a frenzied madness with your leather and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around, it's hot as hell tonight

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!

Here on the stage the Marshalls' noise is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kick your face, exploding feeling nears
Now's the time to let it rip, to let it fuckin' loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill, 'cause this is what we choose

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

Here we go!

Whiplash!

The show is through, the metal's gone, it's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig, again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways, life out here is raw
But we'll never stop, we'll never quit, 'cause we're Metallica

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniacAnd quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules

With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

You labeled me
I'll label you
So I dub thee unforgiven

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

You labeled me
I'll label you
So I dub thee unforgiven

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgivenDolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sin

So you lay us in a line
Push your pins, they make us humble
Only you can tell, in time,
If we fall or merely stumble

But tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away, so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free,
You jab another pin, jab another pin in me

Yeah...
Mirror, mirror upon thy wall
Break this spell or become the doll

See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us,
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time the needles turn from shine to rust

But tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away, so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free,
Jab another pin, jab another pin in me...
Jab it... ("Here come the pins")

Blood for face, sweat for dirt
Three X's for the stone
To break this curse, a ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone

Shell of shotgun, pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith which way we can
To fall in love with life again

To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love, to fall in love
To fall in love with life again

So tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away, so we may start again?

Yeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free,
Jab another pin, jab another pin in me
Yeah-eh-eh-h'eah

No more pins in me, yeah
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more, no more
No, no, no!Tthink you see me in the glass?
Think you hear me?  Better listen fast
Think I see you, gone to seed
I hear your reason is built on greed

You're out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever, alright

You're a financial wizard, yeah, a top tycoon
You're a sweet long lizard with a silver spoon
You've never had it quite so good
You didn't know that you even could

Your time has come to own
Your touch turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever, alright

Been a long time, been a long, long wait
You caught your fingers in the pearly gates
You better leave your number and we'll call you
You know your problem ain't exactly new

Your time has come today
Your face turned away
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever, that's rightI was a Green Beret in Vietnam.
I said no more of your fairy stories
Cause I got my other worries.

Chorus:
53rd & 3rd
Standing on the street.
53rd & 3rd
I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd 
You're the one they never pick.
53rd & 3rd 
Don't it make you feel sick?

If you think you can well, Come on man,
I was a Green Beret in Vietnam.
I said no more of your fairy stories
Cause I got my other worries.

Chorus:
53rd & 3rd
Standing on the street.

I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd 
You're the one they never pick.
53rd & 3rd 
Don't it make you feel sick?

Then I took out my razor blade.
Then I did what God forbade.
Now the cops are after me.
But I proved that I am no sissy.

Chorus:
53rd & 3rd
Standing on the street.
53rd & 3rd
I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd 
You're the one they never pick.

Don't it make you feel sick?

Yo, whoa, yeahPower wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Apathy their stepping stone so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity so deceiving
Through your eyes, their light burns hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Lady Justice has been raped, truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips, now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again, make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell, cannot feel

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us

Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so realPeople think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify
Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too lateTempting you and all the earth to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one you people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate to pull you down into this pit

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins, the end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out and they always shall obey
Follow me now my child, not the meek or the mild but do just as I say

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

Jump by your will or be taken by force, I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit, I am stalking you as prey

Never hunger, never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within, triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends 
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Birth of terror, death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings, spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Into ruin, I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free, flooded, I'll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, Hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
My self is after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me, hahahahaOut of my day

No more nights in this eternal hell
Destination is simple, we move out

 Move up to the line
 Your turn to kill
 What do you say?
 I'm killing time

And he knew what was needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, it's kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he'll take your life

The silence is over, the attack's began
Killing and hatred drive you insane
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message received, we're moving back

 Move up to the line
 Your turn to kill
 What do you say?
 I'm killing time

The sound of gunfire comes through the night
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message received, we're moving back

And he knew what was needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, it's kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he'll take your life

 Move up to the line
 Your turn to kill
 What do you say?
 I'm killing timeWhat don't kill ya, make you more strong
You rise, you fall, you're down then you rise again
What don't kill ya, make you more strong

Rise, fall down, rise again
What don't kill ya, make you more strong
Rise, fall down, rise again
What don't kill ya, make you more strong

Through black days, through black nights
Through pitch black insights

Breaking your teeth on the hard life a-comin'
(Show your scars)
Cutting your feet on the hard earth a-runnin'
(Show your scars)
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
But we die hard

The dawn, the death, the fight to the final breath
What don't kill ya, make you more strong
The dawn, the death, the fight to the final breath
What don't kill ya, make you more strong

Dawn, death, fight final breath
What don't kill ya, make you more strong
Dawn, death, fight final breath
What don't kill ya, make you more strong

They scratch me, they scrape me
They cut and rape me

Breaking your teeth on the hard life a-comin'

Cutting your feet on the hard earth a-runnin'
(Show your scars)
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
But we die hard

Breaking your teeth on the hard life a-comin'
(Show your scars)
Cutting your feet on the hard earth a-runnin'
(Show your scars)
Braiding your soul in a hard luck story
(Show your scars)
Spilling your blood in a hot sun's foray
(Show your scars)

Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
We die hard
We die hard
We die hardYou might find them

Pay no mind to the distant thunder
New day fills his head with wonder, boy

Says it feels right this time
Turned it 'round, and found the right line
"Good day to be alive, sir"
"Good day to be alive," he said, yeah

Then it comes to be that the soothing light
At the end of your tunnel
Was just a freight train coming your way

And the poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me

I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street
You walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes hard
And makes it cry

There's a dirty needle in your child
Haha, stick me
Empty bottles still in hand, still dead
Still me

I'm the suit and tie that bleeds the street
And still wants more
I'm the forty-five that's in your mouth
I'm a dirty, dirty whore

Yeah, look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you wanna see

Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me

Yeah, he wants to become father now
Me again, me
The marks inside your arms
Spell me, spell only me

I'm the nothing face that plants a bomb
And strolls away
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right
As children play

Yeah, look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look it's me
When no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you wanna see

Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me
It's me

Look up to me
What you've been and what you've feared
Look up to me
Look it's me, what you hear

See right through me
See the one who can't be free
See right through me
Look it's me, what no one wants to see

Hey, hey, hey

Hmm, now see the black cloud overhead
That's me
Hmm, in this poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me

And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street
You walk on by
And I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes
Makes it cry

Yeah, look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, hey, look it's me
When no one wants to see

Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me

See right though me
Look up to me
See right though me
Look up to meWhen the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

When you are the ostracized
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes
Twisting of the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Venom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile vein
Internalize and decimate
Patronize and complicate

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

Judas lives, recite this vow
I've become your new God now

Followed you from dawn of time
Whispered thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured your children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown

In the heart of feeble man
Plant the seeds of my own plan
The strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all
Inside you all

So bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kissI run but it stays right by my side

So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays, now it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me

Until it sleeps
(Until it sleeps)
(Until it sleeps)

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed
Don't want it

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you

Until it sleeps


I don't want it, no
Don't want it, want it, want it, no

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me till I'm clean

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps


Until it sleepsOpposition - Contradiction
Premonition - Compromise
Agitation - Violation
Masturbation... On our face
Darkest color: Blistered Earth... True death of life

[Frayed Ends of Sanity: Verse 1]
Never hunger - Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure...
Struggle within triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends...

[And Justice For All: Verse 1]
Halls of Justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of Justice crushes you, overpower

[AJFA: Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

[AJFA: Chorus]
Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone
Pulling your strings... Justice is done
Seeking no truth - Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[AJFA: Verse 2]
Apathy, their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden, deep animosity, so deceiving
Thru your eyes, their light burns, hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

[AJFA: Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

[AJFA: Chorus]
Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone
Pulling your strings... Justice is done
Seeking no truth - Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[Blackened: Verse 1]
Blackened is the end - Winter it will send
Throwing all you see into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth - Never a rebirth
Evolution's end - Never will it mend... Never

[Blackened: Chorus]
Fire, to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

[Blackened: Chorus (alt)]
Fire is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of Humanity
Color our world blackened!  Blackened!Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"

Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"

Scream from my soul
Fate mystified
Hell forever more
Scream from my soul
Fate mystified
Hell forever more

No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"
Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"Feel those things you do
In your eyes, I see a fire that burns
To free the you, that's wanting through
Deep inside, you know: seeds I plant, will grow

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance
That's right, let's dance

Snake! I am the snake!
Tempting that bite you take
Let me make your mind
Leave yourself behind! Be not afraid
I've got what you need: hunger, I will feed

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me, yeah
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance
Ha-ha! Come dance
Yeah, come dancin'

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance

Yeah!  I feel you too!
Feel those things you do
In your eyes, I see a fire that burns
To free the you, that's wanting through
Deep inside, you know: seeds I plant, will grow

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance
That's right, let's dance
H'mm, it's nice to see you here, ha-ha!I'm not expecting people anymore
Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor
Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale

Had a friend once in a room,
Had a good time, but it ended much too soon
In a cold month in that room
We found a reason for the things we had to do

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man, now my room is cold
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul

Yeah yeah
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder taleSmall-town boy, big-time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way

The streets are red, red I'm afraid
There's no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But, oh my God, how it all did change

Now they all pray
"Blood stains, wash away"

He said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

I heard him, he said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

I always said something's wrong
With little strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles

"Gallow calls, son," I say
"Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change"

Now they all pray
"Blood stains, wash away"

He said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

Yeah I heard him, he said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

Yeah, well all the green things died when Ronnie moved to this place
He said, "Don't you dare ask why I'm cursed to wear this face."
Well now we all know why the children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket they'd all fall down, down, down

He said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

Yeah, yeah I heard him, he screamed
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

That's right
All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today

Yeah, run along
All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun todayRow after row
Stone without soul
Or sorrow

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you call, my, name

Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermore

Crow the lonely crow
I think he knows
I'm lonely too
So lonely

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you call, my, name

Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermore

Is that rain or are they tears
That stain this concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding all
It's fall to winter
Back to fall

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel lit right down
Upon the new stone with my name
It's peace at last
Oh, peace at last

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you call, my, name

Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermoreYou better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground

Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes
No, the sunshine never comes

Push you 'cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your time

God I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
In this prison

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison

And I will wait no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear. The sun will shine
This, I swear
This, I swear
This sun will shineThere's someone else controlling me
Death in the air, strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me

Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you"?

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat chilling cold as I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend

My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Someone help me, oh please God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Someone help me, oh please God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Time moving slow, the minutes seem like hours
The final curtain all I see
How true is this? Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be

Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flameThat gather up the magnets
Set before me

I attract you and repel you
A science of the heart
And blood and meaning

The coldness of most beauties
Is a challenge that our youth
Must quickly conquer

There is no time for guilt
Or second guessing, second guessing
Based on feeling

I am the truth, the beauty
That causes you to cross
Your sacred boundaries

I have no morals
Some think me cheap
And someone who despises
The normalcy of heartbreak
The purity of love

But I worship the young
And just formed angel

Who sits upon the pin of lust
Everything else
Bores me

I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up
Your life of reason
I want you on the floor
And in a coffin your soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed
Like a fortune

Oh throw it away
For worship someone
Who actively despises you

For worship someone
Who actively despises you

I am the root
I am the progress
I'm the aggressor
I am the tablet
These ten stories

Worship
Worship

Pain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
I offer them to you as servants
Of the gold that you must give

Pain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
And I'll offer them, I offer them to you
As servants of the gold
That you must give to me

I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up, give it up
Your your life of reason

I want to see you on the floor

And in a coffin, soul shaking
Soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed
Like a fortune, like a fortune
Throw it away

For worship of someone
Who actively despises you

Who actively despises you.Would I use them to get back on track?
Stop to warm at karma's burning
Or look ahead, but keep on turning?
 
Do I have the strength
To know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?
 
Could I have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?

Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place is the means to your end
Touch it, feel it
Green hell

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from it?
I bet you thought you really could

We're gonna burn in hell
Green hell
Like every hell but kind of green
Green hell, green hell
Try let me get back up there
Green hell, green hell
Feel it burning in your cereal
Green hell, green hell
Throw our fuckin' friends inside
Green hell, green hell
Gotta fuckin' pay and you must stay
Green hell, green hell
Cannot refill the torch of death
Green hell, green hell
Hell is reigning in your blood
Green hell, green hell
Gotta burn it all
Green hell

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
Did you run away from me?
I bet you thought you really could
You've come to this as someone told
I bet you never knew you would
Gonna bring
Green hellTruth is an offense
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must

Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself, and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom's ring

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I sayDie die die, my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die die die, my darling
Just shut your pretty eyes
I'll be seein' you again
Yeah, I'll be seein' you in Hell

So, don't cry to me, oh baby
Your future's in an oblong box
Don't cry to me, oh baby
You should have seen it comin' on
Don't cry to me, oh baby
Had to know it was in your cards
Don't cry to me, oh baby
Dead-end soul, for a dead-end girl
Don't cry to me, oh baby
And now your life drains on that floor
Don't cry to me, oh baby

Die die die, my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die die die, my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth
I'll be seein' you again
I'll be seein' you in Hell

Don't cry to me, oh baby
Your future's in an oblong box
Don't cry to me, oh baby
You should have seen it comin' on
Don't cry to me, oh baby
Had to know it was in your cards
Don't cry to me, oh baby
Dead-end soul, for a dead-end girl
Don't cry to me, oh baby
And now your life drains on that floor
Don't cry to me, oh baby

Die die die, my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die die die, my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth
I'll be seein' you again
Yeah, I'll be seein' you in Hell

Die die die

DieDeath Angel's kiss
Brings final bliss
Completely

Empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Ooh, call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Wait, wait patiently
Your death-black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o'er me

Empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Ooh, call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Say, is that rain or are they tears
That stained your concrete face for years?
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel laid right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last, oh, peace at last

Ooh, empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Forevermore
Forevermore
It's just the funeral I've been waiting forOut at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reasons tend to fly away

Like lesser birds on the four winds, yeah
Like silver scrapes in May
Now the sand's become a crust
And most of you have gone away, then you're gone away

Ah, come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you want to know where winds come from

Well, it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the Four Winds Bar
Mmm, yeah

Yeah
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Four winds at the four winds bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door left to take you in
The other one just mirrors it

Hey
Hey
Yeah, hey
Yeah, hey

Ooh, in hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Never warms
Never warms

The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear
Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar

It's a nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me

Yo, hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Call me Desdenova
Eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
Hey, and don't forget my dog
Fixed and consequent

Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me

I have a passionate heart
It can tear us apart
I have the loves of many men
But I don't love any of them

Why do I cheat on me

You have your feelings
I have mine
I spit upon you and change my mind
I have many hearts to break
And many, many, many more to take

Let the light of stars pour out
Like a candle in a spout
Let the wick recede and break
Let the starlight radiate
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I desecrate me
Why do I piss my dreams
That's because that's what it is

I have the drive
I got the scope
If I, if I, if I, could I give you a rope

Your love means zero to me
I'm a passionate-less wave upon the sea
Passionate-less wave upon the sea
Why, why, why
Do you cheat on me

Oh why, do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on myself
Well I got nobody else

I'm only young once
I want to taste it all and have fun
I have no real feelings in my soul
Where most have passion I got a hole
I really got nobody else

I want lovers like the rain
So many of them, so much the same
You say you love me, I know it's true
But I, I, I don't love you

Why do I cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me
Your love means zero to me
A passionate-less wave
Your love means zero to me.It's time to save your world

Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure

Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling

He could just be gone
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive?
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This sinking life, outside it's hell
Inside intoxicating

He's run aground like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast, down with his ship
Fading in the shadows

Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive?
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?

Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive?
So how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?But what the hell is this world coming to?

Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

We all shall die

Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire

Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am

As I watched my mother die, I lost my head
Revenge now I sought to break with my bread
Taking no chances, you come with me
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

Am I evil? Yes I am

I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man

I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire
You can come with me, sweet desire
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man

My soul is longing for, await my heir
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man

Am I evil? Yes I fucking am
Am I evil? I am man, yeahFor I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within

And when I'm branded
This mark of shame
Should I look down disgraced
Or straight ahead
And know that you must blame

I am, I am the secret
I am, I am the sin
I am, I am the guilty
And I, I am the thorn within

Forgive me, father
For I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within

So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you
One and the same are we

I am, I am the secret
I am, I am the sin
I am, I am the guilty
And I, I am the thorn within

I do your time
I take your fall
I'm branded guilty for us all

So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you
One and the same are we

But it's all too much

Invisible kid
Locked away in his brain
From the shame and the pain
World down the drain

Invisible kid
Suspicious of your touch
Don't want no crutch
But it's all too much

I hide inside, I hurt inside
I hide inside but I'll show you...

I'm okay, just go away
Into distance, let me fade
I'm okay, just go away
I'm okay, but please don't stray too far

Open your heart, I'm beating right here
Open your mind, I'm being right here (Right now)
Open your heart, I'm beating right here
Open your mind, I'm being right here (Right now)

Invisible kid
Never see what he did
Got stuck where he hid
Fallen through the grid

Invisible kid
Got a place of his own
Where he'll never be known
Inward he's grown

Invisible kid
Never see what he did
Got stuck where he hid
Fallen through the grid

Invisible kid
Got a place of his own
Where he'll never be known
Inward he's grown

I hide inside, I hurt inside
I hide inside but I'll show you...

I'm okay, just go away
Into distance let me fade
I'm okay, (I'm okay) just go away
I'm okay, (I'm okay) but please don't stray too far

Open your heart, I'm beating right here
Open your mind, I'm being right here (Right now)
Open your heart, I'm beating right here
Open your mind, I'm being right here (Right now)

Ooh, what a good boy you are
Out of the way and you've kept to yourself
Ooh, can't you see that he's not here
He doesn't want the attention you give
Ooh, unplugging from it all
Invisible kid floats alone in his room
Ooh, what a quiet boy you are
He looks so calm floating 'round and around in himself

Invisible kid
Locked away in his brain
From the shame and the pain
World down the drain

Invisible kid
Suspicious of your touch
Don't want no crutch
But it's all too much

Open your mind, I'm being right here (Right now)
Open your heart, I'm beating right here
Open your mind, I'm being right here (Right now)Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops with me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Now the world is gone I'm just one
Oh God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me

Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hellWe do our best, you're the rest, you make it real, you know
There's a feeling deep inside that drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead, you need it oh so bad

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!

Bang your head against the stage like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore
In a frenzied madness with your leather and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around, it's hot as hell tonight

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!

Here on the stage the Marshalls' noise is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kick your face, exploding feeling nears
Now's the time to let it rip, to let it fuckin' loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill, 'cause this is what we choose

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

Here we go!

Whiplash!

The show is through, the metal's gone, it's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig, again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways, life out here is raw
But we'll never stop, we'll never quit, 'cause we're Metallica

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniacAnd quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules

With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

You labeled me
I'll label you
So I dub thee unforgiven

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

You labeled me
I'll label you
So I dub thee unforgiven

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgivenDolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sin

So you lay us in a line
Push your pins, they make us humble
Only you can tell, in time,
If we fall or merely stumble

But tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away, so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free,
You jab another pin, jab another pin in me

Yeah...
Mirror, mirror upon thy wall
Break this spell or become the doll

See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us,
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time the needles turn from shine to rust

But tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away, so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free,
Jab another pin, jab another pin in me...
Jab it... ("Here come the pins")

Blood for face, sweat for dirt
Three X's for the stone
To break this curse, a ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone

Shell of shotgun, pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith which way we can
To fall in love with life again

To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love, to fall in love
To fall in love with life again

So tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away, so we may start again?

Yeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free,
Jab another pin, jab another pin in me
Yeah-eh-eh-h'eah

No more pins in me, yeah
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more, no more
No, no, no!Tthink you see me in the glass?
Think you hear me?  Better listen fast
Think I see you, gone to seed
I hear your reason is built on greed

You're out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever, alright

You're a financial wizard, yeah, a top tycoon
You're a sweet long lizard with a silver spoon
You've never had it quite so good
You didn't know that you even could

Your time has come to own
Your touch turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever, alright

Been a long time, been a long, long wait
You caught your fingers in the pearly gates
You better leave your number and we'll call you
You know your problem ain't exactly new

Your time has come today
Your face turned away
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever, that's rightI was a Green Beret in Vietnam.
I said no more of your fairy stories
Cause I got my other worries.

Chorus:
53rd & 3rd
Standing on the street.
53rd & 3rd
I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd 
You're the one they never pick.
53rd & 3rd 
Don't it make you feel sick?

If you think you can well, Come on man,
I was a Green Beret in Vietnam.
I said no more of your fairy stories
Cause I got my other worries.

Chorus:

I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd 
You're the one they never pick.
53rd & 3rd 
Don't it make you feel sick?

Then I took out my razor blade.
Then I did what God forbade.
Now the cops are after me.
But I proved that I am no sissy.

Chorus:
53rd & 3rd
Standing on the street.
53rd & 3rd
I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd 
You're the one they never pick.

Yo, whoa, yeahPower wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Apathy their stepping stone so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity so deceiving
Through your eyes, their light burns hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Lady Justice has been raped, truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips, now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again, make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell, cannot feel

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us

Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so realPeople think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify
Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too lateTempting you and all the earth to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one you people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate to pull you down into this pit

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins, the end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out and they always shall obey
Follow me now my child, not the meek or the mild but do just as I say

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

Jump by your will or be taken by force, I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit, I am stalking you as prey

Never hunger, never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within, triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends 
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Birth of terror, death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings, spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Into ruin, I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free, flooded, I'll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, Hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
My self is after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me, hahahahaOut of my day

You might blind themOn his crash course with the big time
Pay no mind to the distant thunder

Says it feels right this time
Turned it 'round, and found the right line
"Good day to be alive, sir"
"Good day to be alive," he said, yeah

And the poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me

I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street
You walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes hard
And makes it cry

There's a dirty needle in your child
Haha, stick me
Empty bottles still in hand, still dead
Still me

I'm the suit and tie that bleeds the street
And still wants more
I'm the forty-five that's in your mouth
I'm a dirty, dirty whore

Yeah, look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you wanna see

Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me

Yeah, he wants to become father now
Me again, me
The marks inside your arms
Spell me, spell only me

I'm the nothing face that plants a bomb
And strolls away
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right
As children play

Yeah, look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look it's me
When no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you wanna see

Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me
It's me

Look up to me
What you've been and what you've feared
Look up to me
Look it's me, what you hear

See right through me
See the one who can't be free
See right through me
Look it's me, what no one wants to see

Hey, hey, hey

Hmm, now see the black cloud overhead
That's me
Hmm, in this poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me

And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street
You walk on by
And I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes
Makes it cry

Yeah, look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, hey, look it's me
When no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you wanna see

Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me
Yeah
It's me

Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me

See right though me
Look up to me
See right though me
Look up to meWhen the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

When you are the ostracized
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes
Twisting of the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Venom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile vein
Internalize and decimate
Patronize and complicate

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

Judas lives, recite this vow
I've become your new God now

Followed you from dawn of time
Whispered thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured your children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown

In the heart of feeble man
Plant the seeds of my own plan
The strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all
Inside you all

So bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kissI run but it stays right by my side

So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays, now it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me

Until it sleeps
(Until it sleeps)
(Until it sleeps)

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed
Don't want it

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you

Until it sleeps


I don't want it, no
Don't want it, want it, want it, no

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me till I'm clean

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps


Until it sleepsOpposition - Contradiction
Premonition - Compromise
Agitation - Violation
Masturbation... On our face
Darkest color: Blistered Earth... True death of life

[Frayed Ends of Sanity: Verse 1]
Never hunger - Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure...
Struggle within triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends...

[And Justice For All: Verse 1]
Halls of Justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of Justice crushes you, overpower

[AJFA: Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

[AJFA: Chorus]
Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone
Pulling your strings... Justice is done
Seeking no truth - Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[AJFA: Verse 2]
Apathy, their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden, deep animosity, so deceiving
Thru your eyes, their light burns, hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

[AJFA: Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

[AJFA: Chorus]
Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone
Pulling your strings... Justice is done
Seeking no truth - Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[Blackened: Verse 1]
Blackened is the end - Winter it will send
Throwing all you see into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth - Never a rebirth
Evolution's end - Never will it mend... Never

[Blackened: Chorus]
Fire, to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

[Blackened: Chorus (alt)]
Fire is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of Humanity
Color our world blackened!  Blackened!Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"

Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"

Scream from my soul
Fate mystified
Hell forever more
Scream from my soul
Fate mystified
Hell forever more

No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"
Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"Feel those things you do
In your eyes, I see a fire that burns
To free the you, that's wanting through
Deep inside, you know: seeds I plant, will grow

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance
That's right, let's dance

Snake! I am the snake!
Tempting that bite you take
Let me make your mind
Leave yourself behind! Be not afraid
I've got what you need: hunger, I will feed

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me, yeah
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance
Ha-ha! Come dance
Yeah, come dancin'

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance

Yeah!  I feel you too!
Feel those things you do
In your eyes, I see a fire that burns
To free the you, that's wanting through
Deep inside, you know: seeds I plant, will grow

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance
That's right, let's dance
H'mm, it's nice to see you here, ha-ha!I'm not expecting people anymore
Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor
Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale

Had a friend once in a room,
Had a good time, but it ended much too soon
In a cold month in that room
We found a reason for the things we had to do

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man, now my room is cold
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul

Yeah yeah
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder taleSmall-town boy, big-time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way

The streets are red, red I'm afraid
There's no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But, oh my God, how it all did change

Now they all pray
"Blood stains, wash away"

He said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

I heard him, he said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

I always said something's wrong
With little strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles

"Gallow calls, son," I say
"Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change"

Now they all pray
"Blood stains, wash away"

He said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

Yeah I heard him, he said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

Yeah, well all the green things died when Ronnie moved to this place
He said, "Don't you dare ask why I'm cursed to wear this face."
Well now we all know why the children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket they'd all fall down, down, down

He said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

Yeah, yeah I heard him, he screamed
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

That's right
All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today

Yeah, run along
All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun todayRow after row
Stone without soul
Or sorrow

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you call, my, name

Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermore

Crow the lonely crow
I think he knows
I'm lonely too
So lonely

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you call, my, name

Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermore

Is that rain or are they tears
That stain this concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding all
It's fall to winter
Back to fall

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel lit right down
Upon the new stone with my name
It's peace at last
Oh, peace at last

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you call, my, name

Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermoreYou better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground

Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes
No, the sunshine never comes

Push you 'cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your time

God I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
In this prison

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison

And I will wait no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear. The sun will shine
This, I swear
This, I swear
This sun will shineThere's someone else controlling me
Death in the air, strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me

Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you"?

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat chilling cold as I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend

My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Someone help me, oh please God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Someone help me, oh please God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Time moving slow, the minutes seem like hours
The final curtain all I see
How true is this? Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be

Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flameThat gather up the magnets
Set before me

I attract you and repel you
A science of the heart
And blood and meaning

The coldness of most beauties
Is a challenge that our youth
Must quickly conquer

There is no time for guilt
Or second guessing, second guessing
Based on feeling

I am the truth, the beauty
That causes you to cross
Your sacred boundaries

I have no morals
Some think me cheap
And someone who despises
The normalcy of heartbreak
The purity of love

But I worship the young
And just formed angel

Who sits upon the pin of lust
Everything else
Bores me

I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up
Your life of reason
I want you on the floor
And in a coffin your soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed
Like a fortune

Oh throw it away
For worship someone
Who actively despises you

For worship someone
Who actively despises you

I am the root
I am the progress
I'm the aggressor
I am the tablet
These ten stories

Worship
Worship

Pain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
I offer them to you as servants
Of the gold that you must give

Pain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
And I'll offer them, I offer them to you
As servants of the gold
That you must give to me

I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up, give it up
Your your life of reason

I want to see you on the floor

And in a coffin, soul shaking
Soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed
Like a fortune, like a fortune
Throw it away

For worship of someone
Who actively despises you

Who actively despises you.Would I use them to get back on track?
Stop to warm at karma's burning
Or look ahead, but keep on turning?
 
Do I have the strength
To know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?
 
Could I have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?

Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place is the means to your end
Touch it, feel it
Green hell

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from it?
I bet you thought you really could

We're gonna burn in hell
Green hell
Like every hell but kind of green
Green hell, green hell
Try let me get back up there
Green hell, green hell
Feel it burning in your cereal
Green hell, green hell
Throw our fuckin' friends inside

Gotta fuckin' pay and you must stay
Green hell, green hell
Cannot refill the torch of death
Green hell, green hell
Hell is reigning in your blood

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
Did you run away from me?
I bet you thought you really could
You've come to this as someone told
I bet you never knew you would
Gonna bring
Green hellTruth is an offense
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must

Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself, and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom's ring

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I sayDie die die, my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die die die, my darling
Just shut your pretty eyes

Yeah, I'll be seein' you in Hell

So, don't cry to me, oh baby
Your future's in an oblong box
Don't cry to me, oh baby

Brings final bliss
Completely

Empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Ooh, call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Wait, wait patiently
Your death-black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o'er me

Empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Ooh, call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Say, is that rain or are they tears
That stained your concrete face for years?
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel laid right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last, oh, peace at last

Ooh, empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Forevermore
Forevermore
It's just the funeral I've been waiting forOut at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reasons tend to fly away

Like lesser birds on the four winds, yeah
Like silver scrapes in May
Now the sand's become a crust
And most of you have gone away, then you're gone away

Ah, come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you want to know where winds come from

Well, it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the Four Winds Bar
Mmm, yeah

Yeah
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Four winds at the four winds bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door left to take you in
The other one just mirrors it

Hey
Hey
Yeah, hey
Yeah, hey

Ooh, in hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Never warms
Never warms

The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear
Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar

It's a nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me

Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me

I have a passionate heart
It can tear us apart
I have the loves of many men
But I don't love any of them

Why do I cheat on me

You have your feelings
I have mine
I spit upon you and change my mind
I have many hearts to break
And many, many, many more to take

Let the light of stars pour out
Like a candle in a spout
Let the wick recede and break
Let the starlight radiate
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I desecrate me
Why do I piss my dreams
That's because that's what it is

I have the drive
I got the scope
If I, if I, if I, could I give you a rope

Your love means zero to me
I'm a passionate-less wave upon the sea
Passionate-less wave upon the sea
Why, why, why
Do you cheat on me
Why, why, why
Do I cheat on thee
Oh why, do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on myself
Well I got nobody else

I'm only young once
I want to taste it all and have fun
I have no real feelings in my soul
Where most have passion I got a hole
I really got nobody else

I want lovers like the rain
So many of them, so much the same
You say you love me, I know it's true
But I, I, I don't love you

Why do I cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me
Your love means zero to me
A passionate-less wave
Your love means zero to me.It's time to save your world

Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure

Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling

He could just be gone
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive?
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This sinking life, outside it's hell
Inside intoxicating

He's run aground like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast, down with his ship
Fading in the shadows

Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive?
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?

Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive?
So how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?But what the hell is this world coming to?

Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

We all shall die

Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire

Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am

As I watched my mother die, I lost my head
Revenge now I sought to break with my bread
Taking no chances, you come with me
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am

I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man

I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire
You can come with me, sweet desire
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man

My soul is longing for, await my heir
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself

Sweet and timely whore, take me home

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man

Am I evil? Yes I fucking am
Am I evil? I am man, yeahFor I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within

And when I'm branded
This mark of shame
Should I look down disgraced
Or straight ahead
And know that you must blame

I am, I am the secret
I am, I am the sin
I am, I am the guilty
And I, I am the thorn within

Forgive me, father
For I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within

So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you
One and the same are we

I am, I am the secret
I am, I am the sin
I am, I am the guilty
And I, I am the thorn within

I do your time
I take your fall
I'm branded guilty for us all

So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you
One and the same are we

I am, I am your secrets

I am, I am your guilty
And I, I am the thorn within

Do as you say
Not as you do
You're pushing me to a breakpoint
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint

Self esteem you seem to lack

Bad times are contagious
You laugh and infect

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint

Watching pain is your only pleasure
Sick fascination for someone's disaster
Self suffering since you were born
Mess with the bull and you'll get the horn
Misery, the word that fits
Can't seem to smile till someone's sad

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me, push, push me
Push, push, push me to a breakpoint

In my opinions as a professional, I recommend
We straightjacket the son-of-a-bitch
Lock him in a rubber room
Sedate him, heavily
And when he wakes up
If he wakes up, we'll see
If he can be a nice boy

Well... I don't know... it's gonna hurt me
More that it's gonna hurt him

Let's do it!

You push me to a breakpoint, breakpoint
Push me to a breakpoint, breakpoint
Don't push me, you piece of shitFor me there is no exemption 
I started praying 

I heard the voice of satisfaction 
Needing me for benefaction 
I started pleading 

I heard the bells begin to chime 
Warning me oh lord 
Don't let this be my time 
Don't let this be my time 

I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire 
I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher 
When nothing fits and nothing seems right 
Till the very last breath of my life, I'll be there for you 

You saw me slide, you saw me fall 
We kept our pride through it all 
We started screaming 

When skies are dark, no sun shines through 
I know I see the light in you 
We stopped dreaming and started believing 

I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire 
I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher 
When nothing fits and nothing seems right 
Till the very last breath of my life, I'll be there for you 
I'll be there 

In my hour of need 
You were there always 
Now it's time for me to be there for you too 
Always 

I'll be there for youSands in the hourglass fall for us all
You don't answer me anymore when I call
So much is trapped inside, tangled in your brain
It's getting cold outside and it looks like rain
The sky is falling and my heart is caving in

So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye
The setting of the sun reflection in your eyes
Day after day after day the world will pass you by,
you forget to remember

Solo - Dave

If this is living, what the hell is living for?
You've boarded up your eyes, your mind has locked the door
I'm just a stranger now with an unfamiliar face
You can't recall me at all, 
there's not a trace... not a trace... not a trace
I don't know where you are and my world is crumbling in

So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye
The setting of the sun reflection in your eyes
Day after day after day the world will pass you by,
you forget to remember

Solo - Chris

I just want to talk - What do you want?
But you've nothing to say - Leave me alone
I beg you to come - Get away from me
And you just walk away - I have no idea who you are!
I curse the day that your smile fades away, till then I pray

A burning candle in-between and at both ends
With all that we've learned, yet we still pretend
I just wish you could say my name again

They made the lock and broke the key, 
the culprit was the mercury
The vaccine wipes your memories, 
till you forget even how to breathe
A tangled web they weave, when they practice to deceive

So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye
The setting of the sun reflection in your eyes
Day after day after day the world will pass you by
I said that I'd be strong, but you know I had to lie

You forget to remember... it's time to say the long goodbyeHow much shame, do you have to conceal.
There is no sunshine, just endless nights.
Nobody's there, nobody cares when you cry.

Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.

When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.

How many secrets, do you keep inside?
How many sins, do you have to hide?
The haunting masses, have blackened the sun.
You'll pay for everything you've done
One by one.

Is it my face you see?
Do I mock you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.

When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.

Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.

When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.

Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.
When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.

Monkey on my back, aching in my bones
I forgot you said, "One day you'll walk alone"
I said I need you, does that make me wrong?
Am I a weak man, are you feeling strong?
My heart was blackened, it's bloody red
A hole in my heart, a hole in my head?

Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?
In a dream I cannot see
Tangled abstract fallacy
Random turmoil builds in me
I'm addicted
Addicted to chaos

Lights shined on my path, turn bad days into good
Turn breakdowns into blocks, I smashed 'em 'cause I could
My brain was labored, my head would spin
Don't let me down, don't give up, don't give in
The rain comes down, cold wind blows
The plans we made are back up on the road
Turn up my collar, welcome the unknown
Remember that you said, "One day you'll walk alone"

Your daddy is a wino, and your mommy is quite insane 
From altar boy to sewer rate, you don't give a damn 
Your sister's a junkie, gets "it" anyway she can 
Your brother's a gay singer in a stud leather band 
Your girlfriend's got herpes to go with your help and AIDS 
There ain't one person you know you ain't ripped off yet 

Look deep in the mirror, look deep into its eyes 
Your face is replaced, a creature you despise 
But I know what you're made of, it ain't much I'm afraid 
I know you'll be lying until your dying day 

Make up your stories, the truth's so hard to say 
Brain is numb and your tongue will surely dig your grave 
Your mind is sickly from Alzheimer's Disease 
And decadence and debauchery killed your memories 

You're a liar, liar, liar, everyone can see 
You're a liar, liar, it's all you'll ever be

You shake loose by stuffing your brains
Winning, sinning, beginning, feeding, the needing for bleeding
Bashing, smashing, crashing, fraying, annihilating you

There's someone back in the shadows
You feel though you can't see his eyes
He'll bash your head if you cross him
Ain't quite your average guy

You'd better believe itSomewhere shortly past nine AM
The armored car they wanted to heist wasn't coming
So instead they went for the bank

The fateful duo that sat in the get-away car
Heavily sedated with thousands of rounds
Armor piercing, fully automatic weapons
The bowls of wrath poured out on the ground

Baptized in a firefight, hot blood running cold as ice
Forty-four minutes of target practice, all hell's breaking loose
Outgunned, watching "The Force"
Come to a firefight with a pocketknife
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel
And brought down the beast

This was an accident waiting to happen
It wasn't IF it would happen, it was WHEN
The city's people sabotaged themselves
Calling their firepower an unneeded expense

The two most violent men it seemed couldn't be stopped
Standard police issue guns were just not enough
But SWAT arrived and settled the fight
Between AK-47 and AR-15

Baptized in a firefight, hot blood running cold as ice
Forty-four minutes of target practice, all hell's breaking loose
Outgunned, watching "The Force"
Come to a firefight with a pocketknife
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel
And brought down the beast

Baptized in a firefight, hot blood running cold as ice
Forty-four minutes of target practice, all hell's breaking loose
Outgunned, watching "The Force"
Come to a firefight with a pocketknife
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel
And brought down the beastAnd I ain't superstitious as I break the looking glass
Ain't afraid of no demons, don't make me laugh, haha
I ain't superstitious, under the ladder I go
And I ain't superstitious, it's all bullshit, don't you know?
I ain't afraid of no shadows, I like the dark anyway
And that's a fact, ha

Superstitious
Superstitious

And I ain't superstitious, no such thing as bad luck
And I ain't superstitious, I couldn't really give a fuck
Take your stupid superstitions, find some other paranoidal
Chickenshit, sissy, worm, and tell it to him

Superstitious
Superstitious

I ain't superstitious
I ain't superstitious

And that's a fact, one more time
Come on, shut your mouth
Listen up, hey it's my turnLeaping from the sky
Hurling through the air
Exhilarating high
See the earth below
Soon to make a crater
Blue sky, black death
I'm off to meet my maker

Energy of the gods, adrenalin surge
Won't stop till I hit the ground
I'm on my way for sure
Up here in the air, this will never hurt
I'm on my way to impact
Taste the high speed dirt

Paralyzed with fear
Feel velocity gain
Entering a near-catatonic state
Pressure of the sound
Roaring through my head
Crash into the ground
Damned if I'll be dead

Energy of the gods, adrenalin surge
Won't stop till I hit the ground
I'm on my way for sure
Up here in the air, this will never hurt
I'm on my way to impact
Taste the high speed dirt

Jump or die!

Dropping all my weight
Going down full throttle
The pale horse awaits
Like a genie in a bottle
Fire in my veins
Faster as I go
I forgot my name
I'm a dirt torpedo

High speed dirt
High speed dirt
High speed dirt
High speed dirt
High speed dirt
High speed dirt
High speed dirt
High speed dirtIn the ever expanding world
Of nuclear attacks and global destruction
An invisable circle of silence
Errupts inside your abdomen
Eye to eye no one speaks
Who will be more obsecure
Evil lingers around us
And no one seeks to destroys us
Prepare for interrogation
With the immaculate nucleus 
With imminent imaginations
Through the magic of fascination

Do not go outside the invisable door
'Cause nobody else seems to disappear
As long as all of us are there
Throughout the wear and tear
Of dreams past and present

Here we are on the planet Evilville
Put your head above the sky and detonate
All your phantom fears and all of your dangers that might kill
And why do I the power, however
To destroy our destiny
And the power to overcome this buzzkill
Comes from underneath the earth

Do not go outside the invisable door
'Cause nobody else seems to disappear
As long as all of us are there
Throughout the wear and tear
Of dreams past and presentMultiple personalities
Inside the screams were deafening
Outside the silent agony

Curses coming down
A maelstrom of plagues

Medieval as Merlin
A pact for power was made
Mephistophelian transaction
A virgin soul, the price was paid

Scouring the days
The vortex of pain

A telestic message to you all
Written in torment
Howl out your dirges
Like a sonic blast
Distorted faces twisting in rage
Butt you head against the horns of the ram
You're tortured to appease[]But I'll be back someday
And as I fly away
My hope is that we'll meet again
I'm off to my home away from home
I will miss you
But I know
I know you know

I'm coming home to Arizona
I'm coming home to Arizona

I'll take you everywhere I go
I'll show you everything I see
And as we say so long
I know your tears wish me well
It won't be long till I'm back again
We will meet again
We will meet again
You will see, oh

I'm coming home to Arizona
I'm coming homeThere'll be no tomorrow
Beginning of Sorrow

Easy prey, so innocent
She barely was a teen
Hooked up with Mr. Right now
A nightmare that stole her dreams
Complications come
The Doctor says you gotta know
You decide if the baby lives
But one of you has got to go

The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow, There'll be no tomorrow
The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow

Brought forth in agony
This life was misbegot
Born in an alleyway
A child nobody will adopt
Delinquent in a foster home
His heart is so full of rage
His first name's "Ward"
His last name is "Of the State"

Origo doloris non erit crastinus dies

Like father, like son
Soon he gets revenge
Two souls soon become one
The vicious cycle never ends
Unwanted, unloved
He lives now just to hate
From the pain of being born
And nothing can take that away

The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow, There'll be no tomorrow
The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow...Step up now, you're in for a ride

Yeah right!

I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
'Til they got a hold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see

I got no friends 'cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm gettin' real shot down
And I'm feeling mean

No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene

I'm not hard to get along with...
Ha! I'm impossible!

I got no friends 'cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm gettin' real shot down
And I'm feeling mean

No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene

My dog bit me on the leg today
My cat clawed my eye
Mom's been thrown out of the social circle
And Dad's had to hide
I went to church incognito
And everybody rose
The Reverend Smith, he recognized me
And punched me in the nose, he said

No more
Nice guy
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene, oh yeah

Never said I was that nice in the first place, you know?Take a midnight stroll with me?
Through the misty air the things
I keep I shouldn't dare

My garden's so inviting, and its
Deadly blooms are hiding
Be careful what you touch
Lest the grave is what you lust

Draw the blinds, you're getting tired
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares
From the Deadly Nightshade

Each night at midnight
Dating back into the fog of time
Another victim falls
The things I've done; the voices call

The Hourglass runs out on us
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The killers must be fed, the soil is red
Now that you're dead

Draw the blinds, you're getting tired
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares
From the Deadly Nightshade

Delirium – your burning throat
Mania – your heart rate soars
Hallucination – you're losing your mind
Suffocation – cannot breathe; you're going blind

Draw the blinds, you're getting tired
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares
From the Deadly Nightshade"November 1, 2552 A.D. The spaceship Evilzone arrives on Nuquledom, a bizar-
re planet located 600 billion miles, 10 and a half to the equator... sinist-
er forces abide by moonlight as scientists devise plots to detonate human desires and brutality amongst space travelers in the best interest of the solar system... In the darkest regions of dark space, slayers, offenders and
alien abductors are taking over Nuquledom, having slain humans and extrater-
restrial beings by stalking brains and facing fear amongst the farest areas
of this dreadful plante, the torture affecting their fate will be destroyed
by sinister extraterrestrial masterminds - eventually destroying the whole
planet, not only by chance, but by nuclear annihilation."

"As the solar system evolves into one curiosity-conscious force of death,
the end of the world will take place for 3,450 years and 2,700 centuries...
forcing Nuquledom on certain areas of attack... for billions of weeks, days
and months."

And now, the destruction of Nuquledom begins.

II. 2552 Overture (Instrumental)(20-minute version)

III. Truce Over Agony

Death and darkness are all around this planet
Everytime the planet explodes quickly in a future time
For each bullet of plutonium being hit there
Evil is the enemy of indestructible decline
For this is the kingdom and we are the troubleshooters
Truce over agony will reign again - forever

Our society changes constantly
Torture is within life's hidden reach
This time, extraterrestrials turn head around the earth
And continue turning them around without terminal breach
For this is the kingdom and we are the troubleshooters
Truce over agony will reign again - forever

IV. The Cranial Clock

"To think, the planet Nuquledom has evolved into an indestructible village
- a world of the extraterrestrial underground where human and other adversa-
ries attack. As I enter the experimental intergalatic development center...
known as the National Association for Planetary Research... My partner in planetary combat has completed the development of a experimental space trav-
el adventure policy. He tells me when this scheme happens over the next few
years as scientists and mercenaries began the 52,000-week intergalatic batt-
leground. What the sciensts come up with will be the creation of the crani-
al clock."

"As the battle for control of the Ideatric System begins in honest, the
destruction of Nuquledom is carried out by the forces of evil... the wrath
of Nuquledom will be completed in 52,000 weeks; death is surrounded by the
inquisities of the National Association for Planetary Research by hard ways - doing everything the interrogators have in their power to survive."

Most often, by the sinister forces of evil in Nuquledom
Having performed their random acts of brutal distraction
What matters most likely, should they destroy the entire planet of life
No one is safe because of galatiic annihilation

We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil
What we have done in our battle for semantic freedom
We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil

Just stare at the interplanetary man
He gives each man a helping hand
Join in the Brothership of Mind Control
And attack each other by slamming intergalactic windfall

We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil
What we have done in our battle for semantic freedom
We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil

Pessimism is falling as time slips away
Every space travel is being implanted with a computer chip
The travails of hell is as vital as it is brutal
No attention contact within every day

IIV. Interrogation Conspiracy Trap

"In June of 2553, the National Association for Planetary Research is em-
barking on a plan to detonate Nuquledom, as spaceship pilots continue their
battle for semantic combat during the first year of the annihilation of the
planet."

"For the slayers of human bodies, alien invaders attack the psychological
mystique found deep inside the realm of death. Nuquledom's commander in chief, Rex Nuclear, Ph.D., devises an early warning conspiracy that allows
Nuquledom to be blown up piecemeal within the next few decades."

V. Death Kills The Planet

"Even now distraction erupts again as the forces of danger dangle along
Nuquledom and the 25 planets of the Ideatric System by detonating all areas
of this dreadful community of extraterrestrial life. In the kingdom of inde-
structiveness, torture, death and greed subside in harmony as the annihilat-
ion of Nuquledom continues in the year 2557."

"What happens to visitors when they land on Nuquledom will see a great deal
of intergalatic fears and brutal straits of hell. I must oppose the abductor
and the scientist battling for control of the Ideatric System; and the fears
concerning Nuquledom are in flux as troubleshooters duke their traits of hell as the senses of sight, taste, hearing and touching coexsist."

"Let the destruction of the Ideatric System continue..."

Shoot the laws of gravity in space
Shoot stars directing interplanetary grace
Go after the darkness in the galaxy
Destroy all inhuman thought and reveal the alien enemy
Know what space travelers believe in humanity
What happens to the planetary straits affecting our society

Shoot back at torture and run all fear around
Not for the sake of heart, making for the last guy abound
Shoot back at the enemy behind enemy lines
Heating up controversy concerning inhuman decline
Under attack, slayers have been executed
Not by force, but by abduction
Face your intergalatic fears, vying to face destruction

VI. 2552 Overture (15-Minute Finale)Hydraulics on the move
Kicking in my face
Savage bucking mule

Pummeling my soul
One hundred tons of lead
Trampled under foot
Steamrollers on my head

Crushing down, caving in
My will to live
I'd rather be dead
Scream insane
To have the bullprick
Split their guts
Make them pay, make them bleed
On your back, in your face
Down your throat, up your ass
Bullprick

Pulverizing flesh
Broken bones the aftermath
Can't escape the war
The war machine path

All become one
Flattening the streets
Cry for absolution
Splitting at the seams

Crushing down, caving in
My will to live
I'd rather be dead
Scream insane
To have the bullprick
Split their guts
Make them pay, make them bleed
On your back, in your face
Down your throat, up your ass
BullprickI'll have one more yesterday
Take life from tomorrow
'Cause I've burned out my today

If I get up to the top I know
I'll just go back downhill
Got a terminal future
And it's time to write my will

Down another glass of courage
And a shot of thorazine

We're not ready to see you yet
Ninety-nine ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet

Got a short between the earphones
Wringing my hands in dismay
A more efficient maniac
With two feet in the grave

I ain't got no last words to say
Yellow streak right up my spine
The gun in my mouth was real
And the taste blew my mind

In a black tie and straight jacket
Man, I'm gonna try again

We're not ready to see you yet
Ninety-nine ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet

Demitasse of arsenic
Try on this tie
Never mind the tree

There is only death and danger
In the sockets of my eyes
A playground of illusion
No one plays, they only die

There's a prison in my mind
And the bars are gonna break
I'm as mad as a hatter
And strung out just the same

Taunting rigor mortis
I feel it draw me in

We're not ready to see you yet
Ninety-nine ways to die
We're not ready to see you yetMy body's soaked in a cold, cold sweat 
I reenact the lurid scenes 
And clawed engravings in my head 

Oh, I can't punch hard enough and I run 
I can't kick high enough and I run 
I can't shoot straight enough and I run 
I can't hold on enough and I run 
Oh, I can't stay down enough and I run 
I can't take pain enough and I run 
I can't bleed fast enough 
I can't die dead enough 

The air is thick, but the oxygen's thin 
My heart is beating like a drum, boom! 
And ice is flowing through my veins 
Explosives on my lips and in my lungs 

Oh, I can't punch hard enough and I run 
I can't kick high enough and I run 
I can't shoot straight enough and I run 
I can't hold on enough and I run 
Oh, I can't stay down enough and I run 
I can't take pain enough and I run 
I can't bleed fast enough 
I can't die dead enough 

I don't know what I'm running from 
And I don't know where I'm running to 
There's something deep and strange inside of me I see 

I don't know what I'm running from 
And I don't know where I'm running to 
Something's compelling me to run into the dark 

And now I am more driven than before 
And now I live just to settle score 
And now I feel the nearness of your breath 
Now I introduce you to your death 
Solo- Poland 
Solo- Mustaine 
Solo- Poland 

I am more driven than before 
I live just to settle score 
I feel the nearness of your breath 
I introduce you to your death 
I can't punch hard enough 
I can't kick high enough 
I can't shoot straight enough 
I can't hold on enough 

I can't stay down enough, (die dead enough) 
I can't take pain enough, (die dead enough) 
I can't bleed fast enough, (die dead enough) 
I can't die dead enough, (die dead enough)I like to go
Everyone is there
But their face don't show
If you get inside
You can't get out
There's no coming back
I hear them shout

Welcome to my hide away, my secret place
How I arrived I can't explain
You're welcome to, if you want to stay
But everyone just runs away
Oh

There's a secret place
I like to go
Everyone is there
But their face don't show
If you get inside
You can't get out
There's no coming back
I hear them shout

Let me in
Get me out
Can't do more than twist and shout
Lost my soul without a trace
Found it again in my secret place
Let me in
Get me out
Can't do more than twist and shout
Lost my soul without a trace
In disgrace

I hide from those
That try to find me
Scary things
That's right behind me
I lost myself
I must confess
I can't explain
How I got in this mess

Welcome to my hide away, my secret place
How I arrived I can't explain
You're welcome to, if you want to stay
But everyone just runs away

(My secret place) There's a secret place
(My secret place) There's a secret place
I like to go
(My secret place) There's a secret place
I like to go
Just runs away
My secret placeIt was just another fight
It was words strung into sentences
It was doomed to not be right

There is something wrong with me
There is something wrong with you
There is nothing left of us
There is one thing I can do

Lying on your bed,
Examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch
I throw the switch
Somewhere an electric chair awaits
Hey! This was my life
Hey! This was my fate

This was the wrong thing to do
This was the wrong one to be doing
This was the road to destiny
This was the road to my ruin

Now there's motives for the suspect
Now there's nothing left to say
Now there's method to the madness
Now there's society to pay

Lying on your bed
Examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch
I throw the switch
Somewhere an electric chair awaits
Hey! This was my life
Hey! This was my fate

In our life there is if
In our beliefs there's lie
In our business there is s-s-sin
In our bodies there is die

This was my life
This was my fate
This was my life
This was my fateFor the things I commit each night in my head
Like last night in my sleep, I got to snuff you
But then I woke up again, safe in my little bed

No one is safe
When I close my eyes
I come to take your life

I get to force your untimely disappearance
Each night in my dreams, when I'm fast asleep
I close my eyes and you just vanish
Soon as I lay down my head, when I'm dead to the whole wide world

No one is safe
When I close my eyes
I come to take your life

And then I wake up again
And it was all just a dream
And everything is the same

(Sleepwalker) Did I give you concrete shoes
And throw your body off of a bridge?
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep, pray your soul is mine to keep
I feel you near me
(Go to sleep... Go to sleep... Go to sleep...)
(Sleepwalker)
(Go to sleep... Go to sleep... Go to sleep...)

Just taking a stroll...
Don't go to sleep!
Here's some toothpicks for your eyes!

You always make an excellent cadaver
I roll up your body in a carpet to make music
In the trunk of my limousine, wrapped up in a rug
A fitting end is that I send you up the river like a punk

No one is safe
When I close my eyes
I come to take your life

The angel of death is pissed off at me again
Just because I got to put you out of my misery
It doesn't matter, I am without fear
Now that you're dead, I won't shed another bloody tear for you

No one is safe
When I close my eyes
I come to take your life

I'm calling down the thunder
Then you'll sleep with the fishes
The answer to all of my wishes

(Sleepwalker) Did I tell you I was in movies
Then dump you garotted, lying naked in a ditch?
(Sleepwalker) Everyday, another way
I know you can hear me

I think you'd look nice in a Colombian necktie
Should stop your tongue from wagging the dog
No more stupidity from you, as I pull your tongue through
For a smile from ear to ear, now there's nothing to hear

No one is safe
When I close my eyes
I come to take your life

And then I wake up again
And it was all just a dream
And everything is still the same

(Sleepwalker) Did I give you concrete shoes
And throw your body off of a bridge?
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep, pray your soul is mine to keep
I feel you near me
(Sleepwalker) Or did I tell you I was in movies
Then dump you garotted, lying naked in a ditch?
(Sleepwalker) Everyday, another way
I know you can hear me
(Sleepwalker) Did I buy you the farm?
Put a horse head in your bed?
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep, pray your soul is mine to keep
I feel you near me
(Sleepwalker) Everyday
Everyday, another way
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep, pray your soul is mine to keep
I know you can hear me
(Sleepwalker)
(Sleepwalker)
(Sleepwalker)Something's gone wrong 
Nowhere do I belong 
I listen to the voices in the dark room 

Something's going down 
But I can't make a sound 
Looking past the bars of my mind 

The coat of arms falling 
I hear the doctor calling 
The family crest is falling 
I hear the doctor calling 

Always sharing trips 
Remove me from your lips 
Sight and mind still and never go away 

One too many tantrums 
Deviated symptoms 
Better lock the phantom away 

The coat of arms falling 
I hear the doctor calling 
The family crest is falling 
I hear the doctor calling 
I see the chalkline crawling 
I hear the doctor calling me away 

This place is my home 
My mind still runs free 
The doctor's prescription 
Less for you and more for me 

The coat of arms falling 
I hear the doctor calling 
The family crest is falling 
I hear the doctor calling 
I see the chalkline crawling 
I hear the doctor calling me away 
A merciful embalming 
I hear the doctor calling me awayWithin the human race
Eliminate the poor
How much longer will it take?
Burning up the tents
Of the rank and file
Exterminate their lives
Crack a demon smile

Crushing down
Caving in
Our will to live
Getting rid
Of man's mistakes
To take a lost life
Lock it up, break it down, how much more can we take?

Fight for freedom
Fight authority
Fight for anything
My country 'tis of me

Cry for absolution
It's not the end for me
A last-minute pardon
One final reprieve
Resist the war machine
Don't get in its path
Fight to die a free man
And reap the aftermath

Crushing down
Caving in
Our will to live
Getting rid
Of man's mistakes
To take a lost life
Lock it up, break it down, I don't know how much more I can take

Fight for freedom
Fight authority
Fight for anything
My country 'tis of me



Fight for freedom
Fight authority
Fight for anything
It's my country
Fight for freedom
Fight authority
Fight for anything
My country 'tis of meNo one likes when it fits
So we tell soothing lies
And betray our own lips

The uncivilized world
And its people decay
Once sweet breeze is defiled
Sucking our breath away

Stole a car and I'm on the run
through the night to the rising sun
And the trouble has just begun

Roses on your grave

Watch the authorities come undone
With every standoff that I’ve won
Flirting death is just for fun

Public enemy number one
Born a fugitive father’s son
Another heist of a bank is done

Revelation has come to pass
New world order, will hold the mass

A book written by the man
Used to control and command
All rights will be denied
Without the mark you shall die

No confession, all is known  (All is known)
New world order, you shall be shown  (Shall be shown)

Monitoring all wages
New world order comes in stages
Currency is obsolete
Feel the agony of defeat

Symbol of society today
A must have or you shall pay
As humans flesh leads the mind
Just as a pawn the last martyr dies

No confession, all is known  (All is known)
New world order, you shall be shown  (Shall be shown)

Where hath the apostles gone?
Joining hands with wicked ones

Looking through the night Using infra-red
My target on you Aimed at your head

$10.000 up front $10.000 when I'm through
And I know just what to do And ya know I'll do it too
Then I'm coming back for you Back for you

I do the "getting rid of"
Don't tell me why
Don't need to hear the truth
Don't need the lies
Now pay me quickly
And now we're through
It brings me great pleasure
To say my next job is you
Don't you know that
Killing is my business
And business is good
You'd better believe itOn the truth and the lie
All rise, court's in session
We'll hang someone high

Justice means nothing today
Now that the courts are for sale
Pick a crime from the menu; pick a sentence and defend you
And pay the down payment called bail
The system's for sale

Kick the chair, the ropes tight
Just like one quick wrench, the tooth is out
Friend or foe, i gotta hang 'em dead
Or they'll come back around
Kick it!

The court's wrong when it keeps track
Of victories and defeats
The press that never rest just waits
For someone's soul they can eat

Justice means nothing today
Now that the jury's for sale
Guilty or not, the verdict's a lie
You're going to jail
The system has failed

Kick the chair, the ropes tight
Just like one quick wrench, the tooth is out
Friend or foe, ya gotta hang 'em dead
Or they'll come back 

*guitar solos til end*This is breaking news
It appears that Air Force One was shot down
Somewhere over the Middle East this morning
By a sleeper cell of rogue terrorists firing a Stinger Missile
The Pilot and all passengers are unaccounted for
The President's whereabouts are presently unknown and he is presumed missing
The Vice President, Secretary of State, and principals of the military are assembling
Our nation stands at DEFCON 3

The greatest crisis, will someone come for me?
I "red, white and blew it"
Unleashed revenge, my body is detained
How could anybody do this?

Betrayal, I peel away the days
Medals are useless, Uncle Sam's forgotten me
I'm not important, no one will ever come
I'll never be found, God get me out of this hell

Nuclear battlefields energized
Cold wars are heating up again
The tensions mounting
People lift up your fists in revenge

The stage is set
Who will be the first to blink?
We can't go to war
Remember that "Vietnam thing"

Peace at any price
With a gun to your head, bang, bang
Weakness runs in your family
What runs in mine is death

This is your 5 minute warning
Burn all of your classified documents
And if cooler heads don't prevail
First strike from a political dead man

Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive
He understands only one language - action
And he respects only one word - force
No sign of them stopping, no time for back channel communiques
We need all the help we can get, air strikes and invasions, retaliate, I say!

The will of good men can not counter the terrible strain of war

Blackmail the universe with the greatest of calamities
Awaken those sleeping giants in the dust of the ground
With their skin destroyed, unjust to innocence
Lawful possessor of the world's last 24 hours

Terror and ugliness reveal what death really means
And in hatred you see men as they really are
If chosen over heaven, Earth will have been for them
All along, only another region of hellLeaving me unfulfilled 
Promising compromise 
Championing mediocrity

Time and time again 
What you said ain't what you mean 
Even if all my bones are broken 
I will drag myself back from the edge to

Kill the King, the King is dead, long live the King 
Kill the King, the King is dead, long live the King, 
I am the King, God save the King

Kill the King, the King is dead 
I am the King, long live the King 
Kill the King, the King is dead 
I am the King, long live the King

I reveal a deceiver 
In the highest seat in the land 
His idle hands the Devil's workshop 
Generate more smoke than heat

Time and time again 
What you said ain't what you mean 
Even if all my bones are broken 
I will drag myself back from the edge to

Kill the King, the King is dead, long live the King 
Kill the King, the King is dead, long live the King, 
I am the King, God save the King

Kill the King, the King is dead 
I am the King, long live the King 
Kill the King, the King is dead 
I am the King, long live the King

A new precedent in pain, a new precedent in pain 
Mankind is blown to dust, mankind is blown to dust
An explosion of the Brain, an explosion of the Brain
Spontaneously combust, spontaneously combust

Kill the King, the King is dead,

My wants are all I care
No shame or guilt, there's nothing there
Look deep into my face
I sell deceit without a trace
Fear not what I can do
Unless you want it done to you
Oh oh!

As I climb onto your back, I will promise does not sting
I will tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion
Oh!

My self I'm centered in
There's nothing else, there's never been
And I dream, to be left alone
With the sadness, the madness of my own
Look deep into my soul
It's black as coal like a bullet hole
Fear not, get off your knees
There's no defense, you'll do what I please
Oh!

As I climb onto your back, I will promise does not sting
I will tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion
Oh!

As I climb onto your back, I will promise does not sting
I will tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
I will treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
'Cause you knew all along that I am a scorpion, ya!

My lies, to reach the shore
I aggrandize and nothing more
My hopes, to steal away
All that you love, I'll soon betray
Look deep into my past
The pain I deal is unsurpassed
I'm not a lowly scorpion
I'm so much worse; I'm the fall of man

Fighting broke out overnight between rival factions along the
Israeli/Syrian border. Initial reports say Israeli jet fighters
bombed the guerrilla base killing at least 49 soldiers and 13 civilians

A 49 year old unidentified man went berserk last night
opening fire with a 12 gauge shotgun in a crowded downtown
restaurant. 14 people are dead including 3 children

A crackdown on laboratory experiments on animals is expected
to become law today. Animal rights activists have been
pushing for the bill for 9 years and have taken part in mass demonstrations throughout the nation.

Police have smashed a multi million dollar drug smuggling
ring. 22 pounds of heroin was seized along with a small
amount of cocaine, marijuana, and hashish. 25 people have
been arrested and face charges ranging from smuggling to
possession for the purpose of trafficking.That , and I was hung like a martyr

The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask you're wearing rips

But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities

Engaged in crime, I grasp my throat
Enraged, my mind starts to smoke
Enforced mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry, ow!

And when the story takes a twist
It folds like a contortionist
Sleight of hand and a quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged

Engaged in crime, I grasp my throat
Enraged, my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry

The searing of the sinew
My body fights for air
The ripping of tissue
My lungs begin to tear
Gravity's got my bones
It pulls my flesh away
The steam finally dissipates
I make out my sweating face

Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture its jaw to let me be

A cut-out cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber-hosed the air

Engaged in crime, I grasp my throat
Enraged, my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry again
And again and again, again

Engaged in crime, I grasp my throat
Enraged, my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry, ow!I feel a familiar pain
It seems like years since we've loved
Or even liked and that's a lonely way to be

Drifting alone in a sea of agony
Your face I can't recognize
Don't make this hard on us
I will miss you if you just go away

I did no right you did no wrong
Nothing left but wasted days
I regret you leaving
But I will never take you back

You know what? It's over
I just don't feel the same way as I used to
We've been together forever, but it's over

Goodbye 1000 times goodbye
The thought never crossed my mind
That this would be my last goodbye
Let me put pennies on your eyes
And kiss your lips one last goodbye
My love 1000 times goodbye

It seems nothing good is free
A good thing cost much more than the price
You were good but not that good
Don't kid yourself now it's time to break up

Drifting alone in a sea of agony
Your face I can't recognize
Don't make this hard on us
I will miss you if you just go away

I did no right you did no wrong
Nothing left but wasted days
I regret you leaving
But I'll never take you back

Don't call me anymore. It's just not'
I don't feel the same way about you
Its not as good as it used to be

Goodbye 1000 times goodbye
The thought never crossed my mind
That this would be my last goodbye
Let me put pennies on your eyes
And kiss your lips one last goodbye
My love 1000 times goodbye

I'll always love you but just not like that
Like what?
I want to be honest with you I met someone else
You did what?
And I really, I really love him like I used to love you
Remember the time that I told you that
I was going out of town for business?
Well I went to see him
You know what? You suck!

Goodbye 1000 times
You'll always have a special place
In my heart you know that
It's just I can't be with you anymore it's over
Goodbye 1000 times
Things may not work out with him
Goodbye 1000 times
And if they don't
Goodbye 1000 times
Then I'll certainly call you
Goodbye 1000 times
You mean a lot to me
I still really want to be friends with you
I love you like you're my brotherHe didn't want to end up like them

And now he blames the voices of a toothless wonder

Pounding on the door to make the next score

Anything for a hit, any sin to pay for it
For that next bowl, he'd sell his soul

Spiral to destruction, it's too late to break the spell
He wants the ride to stop on the freight train straight to hell
Without the truth he'll never find in a dungeon of his lies
His cause of death...high speed on burnt ice

Always looking at the ground, a broken beaten man
Memories of his family are calling after him
He can hardly think, hardly walk
Phone keeps ringing, he can't talk
With just one hit the pain would go away
But he's dead if he does

Shadow people follow him everywhere he goes
Looking over his shoulder, the paranoia growsWhen things were good I know you would always be there for me
Yes, It's true; friends like you are few and far between
I wish I may, I wish I might, the things you do ain't quite right
Just ain't right

And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend
Don't turn your back...

Solo - Chris

Solo - Dave

When things were bad you always had something else better to do
It's just a lie to think that I could ever mean anything to you
You steal what's mine then help me look for it;
how many times do I pay for it? How many times?

And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend

And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend

Don't turn your back...

Impossible to break these walls
For you see, the steel is much too strong
Computer banks to rule the world
Instruments to sight the stars

Possibly, I've seen too much
Hangar 18, I know too much

Foreign life forms inventory
Suspended state of cryogenics
Selective amnesia's the story
Believed foretold but who'd suspect
The military intelligence
Two words combined that can't make sense

Possibly, I've seen too much
Hangar 18, I know too muchWhy things go like they do
Somewhere there's a reason
Why some things just fall through
We don't always see them
For what they really are
But I know there's a reason,
Just can't see it from this far

Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice
Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice

I thought I knew it all 
I thought I had it made 
How could it end this way? 
I thought I knew, oh
I thought I knew, oh

Somewhere there's a reason
Why things don't go my way
Somewhere there's a reason
That I cannot explain
Just like the change of seasons
Just may not be my turn
But I know there's a reason
The lesson's mine to learn

Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice
Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice

I thought I knew it all 
I thought I had it made 
How could it end this way?

How could it end this way? 
I thought I knew, oh
I thought I knew, oh

I thought I knew it all
But I knew
But I knew
But I knew
But I knew
But I knew
But I knew
But I knew
But I knew it allA feeling in my soul
I hyperventilate as I accelerate
Till I've lost all control

My speed becomes relentless
Contesting all my senses
White line appearing faster
Prompting death and disaster

My supersonic machine
Get out of my…

Fast lane, like a jet plane
Like a freight train, I'm driving insane
Addicted to the fast lane
Rushing to my brain
No time to explain, this is my domain
Addicted to the fast lane

I look into mirror, red lights are drawing nearer
They think I've met my match
But I shift into high gear, soon they just disappear
You can't jail what you can't catch

My speed becomes relentless
Contesting all my senses
White line appearing faster
Prompting death and disaster

I hear the engines screaming
I'm burning up the… 

Fast lane, like a jet plane
Like a freight train, I'm driving insane
Addicted to the fast lane
Rushing to my brain
No time to explain, this is my domain
Fast lane

Fast lane, like a jet plane
Like a freight train, this is my domain
Addicted to the fast laneFrom faring heavy loads
And the soldiers liberate them
Laying mines along their roads
Sorrow paid for valor 
Is too much to recall
Of the countless corpses piled up 
Along the wailing wall

Melting down all metals
Turning plows and shears to swords
Shun words of the Bible
We need implements of war
Chalklines and red puddles 
Of those who have been slain
Destiny, that crooked schemer
Says the dead shall rise... Again!

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy!

Now we've rewritten history
The one thing we've found out
Sweet taste of vindication
It turns to ashes in your mouth

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy!

If you're fighting to live
It's O.K. to die!
The answer to your question is...
Welcome to tomorrow!

Where do we go from here?
God have mercy!

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy!My sweet lord
Mmmm my lord
Mmmm my lord

I really wanna see you
I really wanna live with you
I really wanna see you
But it takes so long, my lord

Buenos Aires, mmm my lord
Buenos Aires, uhh my lord
Buenos Aires, mmm my lord
Buenos Aires, mmm

[Uninteligible] miss you
I really wanna live here
We really fucking love you
Argentina rules
But it wont take long my lord

Argentina
Argentina
Argentina
Buenos Aires

(Good bye, muchísimas gracias, adiós)That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 

Back when I was just seventeen 
I thought that I knew everything 
I could make it in this scene 
To be a rising star that only gleamed 
But all the answers disagreed 
With the questions held for me 

I was legal now at twenty-one 
I knew the way the world should run 
My God just look what I had done 
Simply drunk and having fun 
Looked for friends, but I found none 
All alone at twenty-one 

The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 
The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 

At twenty-five I was surprised 
That I was still even half alive 
Somehow I managed to survive 
I felt my body's doing time 
And In my back a hundred knives 
From friends at twenty-five 

And now as Gabriel sounds my warning bell 
I'd buy your life, if you would sell 
A year or two, if less compelled 
So live your life and live it well 
There's not much left of me to tell 
I just got back up each time I fell 

The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 
The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 

The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 

The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 
The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 
The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and menI am your ruler, land, sea and air
Immense in my girth, erect I stand tall
I am a nuclear murderer, I am Polaris
Ready to pounce at the touch of a button
My system locked in on military gluttons
I rule on land, air and sea
Pass judgement on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of hell
Will we give warning? Only time will tell
Satan rears his ugly head
To spit to the wind

I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death
Wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death
Wrestles your nostrils

Launch the Polaris
The end doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace

Bomb shelters filled to the brim
Survival, such a silly whim
World leaders sell missiles cheap
Your stomach turns, your flesh creeps
I rule on land, air and sea
Pass judgement on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of hell
Will we give warning? Only time will tell

I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death
Wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death
Wrestles your nostrils

Launch the Polaris
The end doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace

High priest of holocaust, fire from the sea
Nuclear winter spreading disease
The day of final conflict, all pay the price
The Third World War rapes peace, takes life
Back to the start, talk of the part
When the Earth was cold as ice
Total dismay as the sun passed away
And the days were black as night

I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death
Wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death
Wrestles your nostrils

Launch the Polaris
The end doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace

PolarisBefore your journey begins underground
But not before we torment you from your cell
Straight to hell with a short detour in-between

Begging for mercy, all alone
Unable to handle the pressure
Before his mortification
Now let the torture begin

Death by the head crusher
Head crusher!
Death by the head crusher
Ow!

The horrific torture device
For those who fail interrogation
The most painful technique ever known
People thirst for the worst, the skull's disintegration

Beaten, broken, in bloody rags
Adding insult to injury, he recants
But it's much too late
Now let the torture begin

Death by the head crusher
Head crusher!
Death by the head crusher

On your knees, prisoner, take your position
Place your chin forward into the restraints
Your head slowly caves in from the compression
You faint in a blackout from the infernal pain

Twisting, turning the giant screw
Your teeth are breaking loose
Crushed and splintering into your mouth

Winding down, cutting through
Like broken glass being chewed
The fragmented skull and shattering bones
There's nothing you can doI am an Anti-Christ
And I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want, but I know how to get it
I want to destroy, possibly?

'Cause I want to be anarchy
No dog's body

Anarchy for the USA
It's coming sometime it maybe
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic light
Your future dream is a shopping spree

'Cause I want to be anarchy
In the city

Of many ways to get what you want
I use the best, I use the rest
I use the enemy
I use anarchy

'Cause I want to be anarchy
It's the only way to be

Is this the MPLA?
Is this the UDA?
Is this the IRA?
I thought it was the USA, or just another country
And other cunt-like tendencies
'Cause I want to be anarchy
'Cause I want to be anarchy
You know what I mean?

'Cause I want to be an anarchist
Again I'm pissed, destroy!Courthouse tan and beady eyes
A slouch with fallen arches
Purging truths into great lies
A little man with a big eraser
Changing history
Procedures that he's programmed to do
All he hears and sees
Altering the facts and figures
Events and every issue
Make a person disappear
And no one will ever miss you

Rewrites every story
Every poem that ever was
Eliminates incompetence
And those who break the laws
Follow the instructions of the New Ways' Evil Book of Rules
Replacing rights with wrongs
The files and records in the schools

You say you've got the answers
Well who asked you anyway?
Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way?
Don't try to fool us
We know the worst is yet to come
I believe my kingdom will come

F is for fighting
R is for red, ancestors' blood in battles they've shed
E we elect them
E we eject them, in the land of the free, and the home of the brave
D for dying
O your overture
M they will cover your grave with manure
This spells out freedom, it means nothing to me
As long as there's a P.M.R.C.

Pull the strings that make me work

Like a fish with hook in mouth

I'm not a fish

Hook in mouth!And now I reclaim this banner by God my sword and my name 
In a truce sealed by blood within this metal skin and all that I own 
Blood, bone, and courage in my veins and the heart that pumps it 

Drink from the chalice and be reborn 
And the land with me, it will change and transform 

A fighting man sworn to the quest it is the doom of man that they forget 
I have awoken the dragon and all around me the mist of his breath 
Good and evil, there never is one without the other, his brother 
Always there where I least expect it, it will burn me to cinders 

The futures taken root in the present sun 
Don't look into my heart, least of all your own 

No man who is false can win in combat against the truth 
When he lies he murders some part of the world, we must find what was lost 
Hearth and home, wife and child were not for me, I was not yet done 
I never knew how empty my soul was until it was refilled 

Mad distemper strikes both beggars and Kings 
The Necromancer's hard teachings of war and quest 

I am given the right to bear arms and power to meet justice 

I have lived through others for far too long, 
And carried my guilt, my causes, my sins 
I hope in the hereafter when I owe no more to the future 
That I can be just a manChasing shots of tequila, just about high noon
Outside Nuevo Laredo, deep in no man's land
Become a killer or be killed; face down in the Rio Grande

Poverty will turn the life of any good man bad
All love and mercy ever learned, he'll soon forget what he had

Guns, drugs, and money under the Mexican sky
Guns, drugs, and money; pick your poison or you die
Guns, drugs, and money; a pistol pressed to his head
Choose silver and you're rich; you gonna die if you choose lead

He had a suitcase full of money, plenty of ammo for his gun
The sweat rolls down his dirty face, his plans have all come undone
It's just a matter of time, no matter how hard he tries
He hears "Plata O Plomo, Gringo?" the last words before he dies

Poverty will turn the life of any good man bad
All love and mercy ever learned, he'll soon forget what he had

Guns, drugs, and money under the Mexican sky
Guns, drugs, and money; pick your poison or you die
Guns, drugs, and money; a pistol pressed to his head
Choose silver and you're rich; you gonna die if you choose lead

Guns, drugs, and money x4I woke up in a black FEMA box
Darkness was all around me, in my coffin
My dreams are all nightmares anymore
And this is what I dream every night

The leader of the New World Order, the President of the United States
Has declared anyone now residing inside the US of A
Without the RFID chip, you're just an illegal alien
An enemy combatant of America, welcome to the New World Order

This is the end of the road
This is the end of the line
This is the end of your life
This is the . . .

A society in a society, inside the fence life as you know it stops
They got their rules of conduct and we got ours
Be quick or be dead, you crumble up and die
The clock is ticking so slowly and so much can happen in an hour

This is the end of the road
This is the end of the line
This is the end of your life
This is the endgame

I learned my lessons the hard way, every scar I earned
I had to bleed, inside the day yard
A system of controlled movement, like a giant ant farm
Any time is long time, now you're not in charge of your time anymore

This is the end of the road
This is the end of the line
This is the end of your life
This is the end

The ex-President signed a secret bill that can
Land a legal US citizen in jail
And the Patriot Act stripped away our constitutional rights
They say a concentration camp just popped up, yeah, right!

Refuse the chip? Ha! Get persecute and beat
By the tyranny of mind control, for the mark of the beast
All rights removed, you're punished, captured, and enslaved
Believe me when I say, "This IS the Endgame!"I hear you've got a big mouth
Saying things you know aren't true
What the hell are you talking about?

So, now we have a conundrum
And the problem is clearly you
This is the part where it gets ugly
And the solution; getting rid of you

You'll never be safe in the shadows
I'll be waiting in the dark
With a shovel and a bag full of lime
I'll say the devil made me do it

I look who's talking and I see
A big nothing looking back at me
Mine is just to do or die, it's not to reason why
I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie

Don't you think I have friends besides you?
You called me out, you couldn't resist
I'll never stop until I find you
That's when you're gonna cease to exist

How stupid do you have to be?
To think the trail of evidence that you've left
Won't boomerang back in your face
To your moth-eaten brain by meth

Like the wolf that does not howl
Concealed and ready to attack
It's time to pay with your flesh
And you'll never stop me

I look who's talking and I see
A big nothing looking back at me
Mine is just to do or die, it's not to reason why
I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie

The dogs that bark the loudest are the dogs that have no teeth

I look who's talking and I see
A big nothing looking back at me
Mine is just to do or die, it's not to reason why
I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie

Look at you!
Look who's talking, a big nothing looking back at me
Would you look at you?
Look who's talking, a big nothing, that's all I see
Won't you look at you?
Look who's talking, a big nothing, it's what you mean to me
Oh, but you're never gonna be anything anyway
Now roll over and play deadWhen I said I need you
You stretched the truth
When you said that you knew
Just can't believe it
There's nothing to say
I was almost honest
Almost

Living alone
Can't stand this place
It's four in the morning
And I still see your face

I was nearly pure
When I said I loved you
You were semi-sincere
You said I'd bleed for you
We were kind of candid
Now you've gone away
You were almost honest
Almost

Living alone
Falling from grace
I want to atone
But there's just empty space
I can't face tomorrow (I can't face tomorrow)
Now you're not coming back (you're not coming back)
Walked off in the night (walked off in the night)
And just left me the tracks (and just left me the tracks)

I question the call
By the tone of your voice
I know I should hang up
But I don't have a choice

It happened that night
When you told me to go
Don't ask who's to blame
I don't know

Living alone (living alone)
Falling from grace (falling from grace)
I want to atone (I want to atone)
But there's just empty space (but there's just empty space)
I can't face tomorrow (I can't face tomorrow)
Now you're not coming back (now you're not coming back)
Walked off in the night (walked off in the night)
And just left me the tracks (and just left me the tracks)

(Almost) Almost honest
(Almost) I was almost honest
(Almost) I was almost honest

(Almost) Almost, almost honest
(Almost) Almost honest
(Almost) Almost honestWishing it will go away, but nothing's getting done
A shot heard 'round the world, when a mother's baby dies
We the people point our fingers, blame and wonder why

Hey
Hey
Hey

Face it and fight or turn high tail and run
'Til it comes back again just like the rising sun
Say they do all they can, it's just another lie
The answer's plain to see, nobody wants to try

Hey
Hey
Hey

Ooh, there's no recess and no rules in the school of life
If you listen very closely you'll see what it's like
Have cool, will travel

Ooh, there's no recess and no rules in the school of life
And if you listen very closely you'll see what it's like
Tell myself it ain't true, they just can't see
Grown up or sewn up, the medicines worse than the disease
Oh, Have cool, will travel
(Here we go) Have cool, will travel
Have cool, will travel!Everything's helter-skelter
Listen up! I warn you
Run for cover, run
Bang! It happened
Time's up, armageddon
Fire! Meltdown
The sky is crumbling in

Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtains

Escape? You're joking
Can't find no place to run
Hair is burning
My flesh is bubbling up
Blood is boiling
Taste copper on my tongue
Fate is coming
Welcome it with a smile

Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtains... Fall!
Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtains





Am I dreaming?
My heart pounds my chest
Held for ransom
In a spider's web
Suffocating
No one hears my calls
Neverending
Till the black curtain falls

Snakes surround me
Offering their death kiss to me
Down... I'm drowning
How long I'll hold my breath?
Dogs are chasing
My legs are paralyzed
Pray... don't find me
My life is fading fast

Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtains... Fall!
Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtainsDifferences don't exist in harmony!
Survival is superiority.
We don't need no hands across the sea!
We've got...

Foreign policy

The lines are drawn!
Establish the new order!
Suspect everyone
Know your enemies!
We've got...

Foreign policy

Hatred is purity!
Weakness is disease!
Where we bury you
It's manifest destiny!
We've got...

Foreign policyYou'll serve only me
And my will to kill
You will kill for me
All that I desire
All that I command
You are here for me
I'm your Master
My creation
I will make for you
A soul mate to love
Unlike your love for me
And you will take my name
She will be your bride
She will serve me too
And I will introduce to you
The Bride of FrankensteinTalk to each other become close
In a town much like a prison cell

People speak our names
On the street in hushed tones
Oh the stories they'd tell
If anyone would listen

You come from a town where
People don't bother saying hello
Unless somebody's born or dies

And I come from a place where they
Drag your hopes through the mud
Because their own dreams are all dying

And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
The sounds of the night should make us anxious
But it's much too late when the fear is gone

I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you
Where we can be together, I promise you
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you
I promise, I promise

There's so many fighting
To get past the Pearly Gates
But nobody ever wants to die or get saved

Their intentions aren't that good
And I can smell the asphalt
That's their personal road to hell being paved

And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
But it's much too late when the fear is gone

I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you
Where we can be together, I promise you
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you
I promise, I promiseAnd my misfit's way of life
A dark, black past is my
Most valued possession
Hindsight is always twenty-twenty
But looking back, it's still a bit fuzzy
Speak of mutually assured destruction?
Nice story, tell it to Reader's Digest!

Feeling paranoid, true enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me and my air is getting thin
I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet
I'm chomping at the bit and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets

Hello me, it's me again
You can subdue, but never tame me
It gives me a migraine headache
Sinking down to your level
Yeah, just keep on thinking it's my fault
And stay an inch or two outta kicking distance
Mankind has got to know
Its limitations

Feeling claustrophobic, like the walls are closing in
Bloodstains on my hands and I don't know where I've been
I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet
I'm sharpening the axe and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets



Well me, it's nice talking to myself
A credit to dementia
Some day you too will know my pain
And smile its "black-tooth grin"
If the war inside my head
Won't take a day off, I'll be dead
My icy fingers claw your back
Here I come again!!!

Feeling paranoid, true enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me and my air is getting thin
Feeling claustrophobic like the walls are closing in
Bloodstains on my hands and I don't know where I've been

Once you committed me
Now you've acquitted me
Claiming validity
For your stupidity
I'm chomping at the bit
I'm sharpening the axe
Here I come again, oh-whoooa!
Sweating bulletsEthnic cleansing with no defending
These acts of genocide
A fatal ending with no surrendering
To cover up the crimes and lie

(Chorus)
Smart bombs, precision guided armament
A more sophisticated way to end up dead
Still we search and invent such intelligent weapons
That kill each other like the Gears of War

Gears of war... (x2)
Hoo-rah!!!
Gears of war... (x2)

When you ride with thieves, then you die with thieves
Cross my heart and hope that you die!
When the smoke has cleared, the devil's in the mirror
And you see his warheads paint the sky, now you die!

(Chorus)
Smart bombs, precision guided armament
A more sophisticated way to end up dead
Still we search and invent such intelligent weapons
That kill each other like the Gears of Waaaaaaaaaaaar

(Guitar Solo)Now you'll know why death was summoned here tonight
I'll recall my perils, they'll kill me in pride
No, I can't run away, there's no place to hide

Though too much to live for, I owe enough to die
Ask not for salvation, my death shall mean their lives
Hatred and guilt, the altar they've built, high priests of sin
Destiny, fate, the wicked one's gate beckoning you in
Down the walkways, through the blood stained town
Looking down the cross, bleeding from the crown
Led to stay to die besides the thieves
Kill the king of the world to be

And now to you, this will come
A putrifying pestilence
More noxious than the serpent's breath
Malevolently destined
More corrupt than the malice of choronzon
More diseased than the wind
Of the moonlight sun
Putrefaction you have caused
No need for confession
Now you wish you had a god to stop your demolition
Crushing the bones of the hundredfolds
Swinging the judgement hammer
Man, woman, child, no-one is safe
The heads of the dead are the banner

And this was all you got
So don these broken wings
Sands of time run out
Bells of Hades ring
Is this a nightmare
To unhallow thy name
Smell of brimstone
Dancing in the flames
No help now as you fulfill his task
Chief of evil has got you by the ass
Set free to sit upon the throne
Just a dream?
You're weeping all alone!

Looking down the cross
(Speak no evil)
I'm looking down the cross
(Speak no evil)Trouble is coming, hell on two wheels
Hide in the shadows awaiting defeat
Or live by the sword and choose to be free

We say retribution
We say vengeance is bliss
We say revolution
With a cast-iron fist

Coming down the road
Watching every move
Kicking in the door
Taking what we choose

Anarchy's coming to town
A fiery invader
Burning it down to the ground
The Disintegrators

We say retribution
We say vengeance is bliss
We say revolution
With a cast-iron fist

Coming down the road
Watching every move
Kicking in the doors
Taking what we choose

Anarchy's coming to town
A fiery invader
Burning it down to the ground
The Disintegrators

Anarchy's coming to town
A fiery invader
Burning it down to the ground
The Disintegrators

Anarchy's coming
Here it comes
Burning it down to the ground
Dis-in-tegratorsFeel a might unsteady but still I have to play
Six to one's the odds and we have the highest stakes
And once again I gamble with my very life today

Highly polished metal, the oil makes it gleam
Fill the terror chamber, your mind begins to scream
Your life is like a trigger, never trouble till you're squeezed
Now you crack a smile, as you give the gun a tease

Place the pistol down, now give the gun a spin
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in
A hateful way of vengeance, a bit of playful sin
Load another bullet, now the second round begins

A couple grains of powder, a couple grams of lead
A touch against the trigger, a touch inside the head
Take another drink and raise the last bets
Think about my last words, they might be what I just said

A click comes from the hammer that couldn't drive a nail
Sense the numbing cold blue or the red of Hades' grill
A fraction of a second, do you lose or maybe still
Pass it to the left, and collect your mighty kill

Add another bullet, the third round begins
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in
Please, no I.O.U.'s, no markers for death
Does anybody play?

Anybody
Somebody
Everybody

You, you, next victim
You next to die
You, you, next victim
You, your turn to die
You, come on, next victim
You, your turn to die
You, come on, next victim
You, your turn to die
You dieIf you only want to live and die in fear
They tell us to believe just half of what we see
And absolutely nothing that we hear

Resist the twisted truth no matter what the cost
Supplant the rights with wrongs inside our heads
Outlawing all the questions to the answers
That no one likes when someone ends up dead

Dystopia
Dystopia
Dystopia
Dystopia

"What you don’t know" the legend goes "can't hurt you"
If you only want to live and die in a cage
There's panic and there's chaos rampant in the streets
Where useless thoughts of peace are met with rage

Demoralized and overmastered people think
The quickest way to end a war is lose
Dictatorship ends starting with tyrannicide
You must destroy the cancer at its root

Dystopia
Dystopia
Dystopia
DystopiaYou live in a web of deceit
You want it all including me
You like it all to be neat

I come to you when shadows fall
I leave as the dawn arrives
Hide the truth to deceive them all
How my good intention lies

Try to silence the suspicions
Feeding the dark inhibitions
We can never let anyone see
The sin I bring called ecstasy
The sin I bring
Ecstasy

Secret meetings that we hide
Deeds of iniquity
The price of foolish pride
The cost of immorality

And we hide the truth to deceive them all
And the pain of what will never be

Try to silence the suspicions
Feeding the dark inhibitions
We can never let anyone see
The sin I bring called ecstasy
The sin I bring
EcstasyI need to be me, 'cause you're all to clear
And I can see there's something wrong with you
Oh, what do you expect me to do?
At least I gotta know what I wanna be
Don't come to me if you need pity
Are you lonely, you got no-one
You got your body in suspension
That's a problem, problem, problem
The problem is you
Eat your heart out on a plastic tray
You don't do what you want and you fade away
You work for me, you're working nine-to-five
It's too much fun of being alive
I'm using my feet for my human machine
You work for me, living for the screen
Are you lonely, all needs catered
You got your brains dehydrated

Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Oh what what you gonna do, problem, problem
Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Well, what you gonna do with your problem
The problem is you, problem

I ain't death trip, but I ain't automatic
You work for me, just stay ecstatic
Don't you give me any orders
To people like me, there is no order

Bet you thought you had it all worked out
Bet you thought you knew what I was about
Bet you thought you'd solved all your problems
But you are the problem

Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Oh, what you gonna do with your problem?
I'll leave it up to you, oh problem
The problem is you, you got a problem
Oh what you gonna do?
They know a doctor, gonna take you away
Thay take you away and they throw away the key
They don't want you and they don't want me
You got a problem the problem is you
Problem, well, what you gonna do?
Problem, have you got a problem?
Problem, well you got a problem
Problem...I knew Jack Kennedy
Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine
Senator, You're no Jack kennedyThe way you look at me
And it's a hard time
Time you been givin' me

Come on and open up
Open up to me
So you can realize
That I could set you free

Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted days

Well, it's a strange place
That you've been livin' in
And it's a strange line
You've been deliverin'

I think I like it
But I'm not really sure
Don't wanna to fight it
Just wanna feel some more

Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted days

Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted daysAfter pulling another gruelling nine to five
I live from credit card to check
The paper money's whirling by
And I hardly just, just barely, only just survive

I'm living on the edge
Reality is teetering
My mind is on the brink

How will I face the day tomorrow if I can't make it through today?
I got nothing left to lose, but my sanity and the right to go insane
I got nothing left to lose, but my mind
I got nothing left to choose, so I think I'll go insane

My stomach aches from insufficient funds
My cheeks are gaunt, my guts are overdrawn
My head pounds, starvation's given me the shakes
Too much squalor, too much pressure, and now I'm getting pissed

I'm living on the edge
Reality is teetering
My mind is on the brink

How will I face the day tomorrow if I can't make it through today?
I got nothing left to lose, but my sanity and the right to go insane
I got nothing left to lose, but my mind
I got nothing left to choose, so I think I'll go insaneA plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough, euphoria's high
More borrowed money, more borrowed time
Backed in a corner, caught up in the race
A means to an end ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

Barren land that once filled the need
Are worthless now, dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip
Nature's scales are forced to tip
The heartland dies, loss of all pride
To leave ain't believing, so try and be tried
Insufficient funds, insanity and suicide

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream



Now with new hope
Some will be proud
This is no hoax, no one pushed out
Receive a reprieve and be a pioneer
Break new ground of a new frontier
New ideas will surely get by
No deed or dividend, some may ask why
You'll find the solution, the answers in the sky

Rise so high, yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough, euphoria's high
More borrowed money, more borrowed time

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

HolocaustIt's four in the morning
I had too much to drink
Said I was out with the boys

I creep in my bedroom
I slip into bed
I know if I wake her, I'll wake up dead

I wonder, will she find out
About the other, other lover
Diana

Wake up dead, you die
Wake up dead, and buried
Wake up dead, you die
Wake up deadHer lips are poisonous venom
Wicked temptress knows how to please
The priestess roars, "Get down on your knees"

The rite of the praying mantis
Kiss the bones of the enchantress
Spellbound searching through the night
A howling man surrenders the fight... the fight

One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf

One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf

My desires of flesh obey me
The lioness will enslave me
Another heartbeat than my own
Sound of claws on cobblestone, I'm stoned

One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf

One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf

Beware what stalks you in the night
Beware the she-wolf and her bite
Her mystic lips tell only lies

Beware what stalks you in the night
Beware the she-wolf and her bite
Her hidden will to kill in disguiseHow I could walk away from something so rare 
But you see it all got too demanding, yeah 
And I just didn't care, I just didn't care, if I cared, if I cared 

Lately, I've been left wanting, but not wanting you 
Attraction that once was is no longer there, ooh 
And it sucks to be taken for granted 
When the veil is drawn and there's only air 

I had to walk away 
Give up something I love 
For what I loved even more 
And save my tears for you 

Everything has lost its meaning; I had to let it go 
To find myself, myself, and start something new, brand new 
Forced to look deep in the mirror, face who I really am 
Now it's just me, cause I can't afford you 

I had to walk away 
Give up something I love 
For what I loved even more 
And save my tears for you 

I gave up something I loved 
For what I loved even more 
And I saved my tears for you 
In a vial and walked away 

You were so beautiful to look upon 
I could see the light in your smile 
Your eyes were the windows into your soul 
Your body was heavenly just like the sky 

Until all your good looks betrayed you, which ain't much 
Counted on your counterfeit smiles for too long 
Your eyes are empty windows: broken 
The body may be here, but the soul is gone 

I saved my tears for you in a vial 
From everything wicked thing that you did, that you said 
To send away, buried with your love 
So many tears in a vial, now that you're gone, and now that you're deadAnybody searching for action
Anything to fill the emptiness inside
Any place that the streets are empty
Any takers wanna pour out their lives
With fire and lightning shooting from my hand
And desolation written across my eyes
My itchy fingers on a hairpin trigger
My tempers hot my patience's taken flight

Solo – Drover
Solo –Mustaine

Inside the abattoir
The cover charge is somebody's gotta die
Now, I hear you screaming out for mercy
Last man that's standing wins the fight
Too late, I see your end zero in on you
Even mortal enemies, they can't deny
Let me help you up again
The wings of God surround me
I live to play because I know I'll never die

Solo – Drover
Solo –Mustaine
Solo – Drover
Solo –Mustaine

If I win again, I'm still the champion
And if you win, HA, that's just impossible!
I don't play for keeps; I don't play for your soul
I don't play to win; I don't play for it all
I play for blood.

Solo –Mustaine
Solo – Drover

I don't play for keeps, I play for blood

Solo –Mustaine

I don't play for your soul, I play for blood

Solo – Drover


I don't play to win, I play for blood

Solo –Mustaine

I don't play for it all, I play for blood

Solo – Drover

Play for bloodCrushing our potential and piling it on, how will history portray us?
Attack the family, attack their faith and dreams
Attack the body and the head will fall

A lasting legacy or ruin brought in haste?
The enemy of truth is lying there in state

Another day, another manufactured crisis keeping the people distracted
There's no one playing by the rules anymore, how will history portray us?
A broken backbone with nothing left to lose?
That hate the sight of all the ones that do?

A lasting legacy or ruin brought in haste?
The enemy of truth is lying there in state

A shiny new agenda, birthed from a depraved mind
Of failing us on purpose, to culturally sanitize
Its opiates for the masses under cloak as hope and change
The "new normal" or just more of the same?

The perfect plan
Must have an alibi
And the perfect pawn
To spew the party line
Of the perfect falsehood
Spoke a thousand times
The perfect words
Cover the greatest crime

Hell is turning itself inside out
To lead its path up to meet us
And we deliberately take
A step, one foot closer to the graveSo quiet now she's gone
The dust accumulates into
Mountains on the ground

My paper's piled on the steps
Her flowers all have died
I'm searching everywhere
For someone I'll never find

The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
It's too late, when you've lost your soul
I left her everything, she only left my ring
My world is darker now than the blackest crow

Slide - Dave

Shadows fill this place
She's been away so long
The wallpaper leaves a stain
Where pictures once belonged

You think I would have known
Something was going on
Her kisses were so cold
Her loving touch withdrawn

The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
It's too late, when you've lost your soul
I left her everything, she only left my ring
My world is darker now than the blackest crow

Solo - Dave

They never do teach you how to walk away from someone that you love

The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
I know it's too late, when you've lost your soul
The fires all but gone, my world is darker now
Than the blackest crow

Slide - Dave

The blackest crow...Where could you be found? 
Were you at the front of the stage? 
Or in the underground 

From SF out to Old Bridge 
New York back to LA 
The world of metal changed forever 
Back in the day 

Well that was back in the day 
And if you weren't there 
It doesn't matter anyway 
Because you wouldn't understand 

Live to die and die to play 
Every day and place 
Leave a path of metal 
Across the world from stage to stage 

Well that was back in the day 
And if you weren't there 
It doesn't matter anyway 
Because you wouldn't understand 

In denim and leather 
We were all part of one force 
Knocked Rock and Roll on its ass 
And put metal on the course 

Higher! 
Higher! 
Higher! 
Higher! 
Back in the day 
You weren't there 
It doesn't matter 
Because you wouldn't understand 

This is our way of life 
A life that was born free 
To follow orders how to live 
Was never meant to be 
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh 

Peals of thunder, sheets of lighting 
The power hits the stage 
The music was exciting 
The mania raged 
On, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh 

We all had the fever 
Our ears started to ring 
Feeding this wildfire 
Consuming everything 
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh 

Metal's King back then 
And still is to this day 
Others imitate or challenge 
But it never goes away 
Oh, oh-oh, oh-ohWashed up, left for dead
I'm lost inside the desert
Of every word you said
Like a nuclear reactor or TNT
I'm thinking about the times when you lied to me
All the innuendo caught up on your hook
I was just a name in your little black book, oh

In your little black book
Oh

I'll get even with you
I'll get even with you, even with you

I'm bitter and I'm twisted
I haven't slept in days
I'm lonely and I'm angry
I can't make it go away
I'm like a bomb that's ticking, I got voices in my head
I got a doll with needles in, wishing you were dead
I'll get you back somehow, that's what I'm gonna do
I'll get you back somehow, your nightmare's coming true

It's coming true

I'll get even with you
I'll... that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna get even with you
I'll get even with you, even with you, even with you

You better look behind you
'Cause there I'm gonna be
I'll be standing in the shadows
With who I used to be

He's slightly schizophrenic
Me and me, and me, and me agree
That you are gonna pay
For what you did to me

I'll get even with you
I'll get even with you

I'll get even with you
I'm gonna get even with you
I'll... that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I'm gonna, gonna

I'll get even with you, even with you (gonna even)
I'll... that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna
I'm gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna

I'll get even with you
I'm gonna get even with you
I'll get even with youSets the stage today
The more insatiable the sex
The more swelled our tongues became

As pre-historic as it seems this is now, today
As pre-historic as it seems this is now

Talkin' 'bout no vision
Talkin' 'bout no dream
The harlot puddles for her lies
From where she speaks

I look above and see entrails in the sky
This one ain't over till the fat lady dies

One man rules the world
And rides the seven-headed beast
Ten diadems to crown them all
The world, religion at his feet

Dreams are told of dreams of old
This day will surely come
So, run my child and hide your face
Once you've been marked, you're finished, done

You'll become one
You're mine
You're one

I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass away
I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass away

Vengeance is mine
Vengeance is mine
The Netherworld and Sheol are never satisfied
So the eyes of man are never satisfied

I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass awayI saw her face
It was the face that I loved
And I knew I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray
That they'd go away
But still they'd begin
Needles and pins

I heard somebody fixed today
There was no last goodbyes to say
His will to live ran out
I heard somebody turned to dust
Looking back at what he left
A list of plans and photographs
Songs that never will be sung
These are the things he won't get done
The things he won't get done

I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)
I've seen them crawl from the cradle (to the gutter on their hands)
They fight a war but it's fatal (it's so hard to understand)
I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)

Just one shot to say goodbye
One last taste to mourn and cry
Cry, cry
Scores and shoots, the lights go dim
Just one shot to do him in
He hangs his head and wonders why
Why the monkey only lies
Lies, lies
But pay the pauper he did choose
He hung his head inside the noose
He hung his head inside the noose

I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)
I've seen them crawl from the cradle (to the gutter on their hands)
They fight a war but it's fatal (it's so hard to understand)
I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)

Cryptic writing
On the wall (the beginning of the end)
I've seen myself use the needle (seen the needle in my hand)

I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)
I've seen them crawl from the cradle (to the gutter on their hands)
They fight a war but it's fatal (it's so hard to understand)
I've seen myself use the needle (seen the needle in my hand)
(In my hand)
(In my hand)
In my handAnd you brought your motor to me
You're a burner, yeah, a real motor car

Said you want to get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, ya know, luckily for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me, I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat

We were shifting hard when we took off
Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top end, you know it feels so slow

Said you want to get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, ya know, luckily for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me, I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat

I'm giving you my room service
And you know it's more than enough
Oh, one more time, you know I'm in love

Said you want to get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, ya know, luckily for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me, I do it for my life, fuck yeah
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat, oh yeahA mighty wreck that once was proud
Ate alive by oxidation
Abandoned by a crew of cowards
Navigation systems failed
Computers crashed and they all fall down

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18 I know too much

All the guilty paid the price
Suspended by their broken necks
No one survived to tell the story
When foreign life forms resurrect
And military intelligence is
Still two words that can't make sense

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18 I know too muchI'm a social disease 
I've come for your wealth 
Leave you on your knees 
No time for feeling sorry 
I got here on my own 
I won't ask for mercy 
I choose to walk alone 

Oh what's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine too 
If you shake my hand, better count your fingers

What if I do get caught? 
What if there is no judgment? 
If I'm right, I lose nothing 
If you're right, I lose it all

And I oughta get caught 
Because I'm doing something wicked 
I'm guilty, haunted by my fears 
And the only consequences 
Are dread and the fugitive mind 

You built walls to protect you 
So no one will infect you 
Pursued by those out there 
That vanish in thin air 
Come a long way to find 
What you really left behind 
You don't know when the end is 
But it's coming fast

Oh what's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand, better count your fingers

What if I do get caught?
What if there is no judgment?
If I'm right, I lose nothing
If you're right, I lose it all

I oughta get caught
Because I'm doing something wicked 
I'm guilty, haunted by my fears 
And the only consequences 
Are dread and the fugitive mindThey said it'd never come, we knew it was a lie
All forms of life die now, the humans all succumb
Time to kiss your ass goodbye, the end has just begun

Distorted figures walk the street, it's 1999
Weeds once underneath your feet have grown to vines
Bodies melted like a candle, a land without a face
No time to change your fate, no time left, it's too late

The arsenal of Megadeth can't be rid, they said
And if it comes, the living will envy the dead
Racing for power and all come in last
No winning, first stone cast
This falsehood, worldly peace
It's treaties soon will cease
No one will be left to prove that humans existed
Maybe soon the children will be born open-fisted
We all live on one planet, it will all go up in smoke

Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy
And now the final scene, a global darkening

Dig deep the piles of rubble and ruins
Towering overhead, both far and wide
There's unknown tools for World War III
Einstein said, "We'll use rocks on the other side"

No survivors, set the world afireTalk to him every day
What do you mean I don't support your system?
I go to court when I have to
And what do you mean I can't get to work on time?
Got nothing better to do
What do you mean I don't pay my bills?
Why do you think I'm broke? Huh?

If there's a new way
Well, I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time

What do you mean I hurt your feelings?
I didn't know you had any feelings
What do you mean I ain't kind?
I'm just not your kind
What do you mean, I couldn't be the President
Of the United States of America?
Tell me something, it's still "we the people", right?

If there's a new way
I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time

Woah woah

Can you put a price on peace?

Peace
Peace sells
Peace
Peace sells

Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?

Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?

Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?

No, no no no no
Peace sells (Oh)
Peace sells, ahI saw you, across the room
I knew I had to have you

Thus started the chase
I knew I would do anything
To take your hand and make you mine

But I learned long ago
If you love someone, you have to let it go
The hardest part of letting go
Is saying goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

(Sealed with a kiss)

Fettered away in a makeshift cell
Beneath the venomous moonlight
I unleash my plan to watch you fail
The one I held so high

Go to sleep, my love
Taste my sweet revenge on your lips
It's sealed with a kiss

I return to the masquerade ball
And leave the lone figure weeping
Stone by stone, immured in the wall
Forever left in safekeeping

Go to sleep, my love
Taste my sweet revenge on your lips
It's sealed with a kiss

(The hardest part of letting go... (continued))

But I learned long ago
If you love someone, you have to let it go
Let it go, let it go
The hardest part of letting go
Is saying goodbye
Goodbye, goodbyeMy faults were letters carved in stone
As meaningful to you as words written in water
I'm left to walk this world alone

Fill solos - Mustaine

In a broken mold they made me
The black sheep of the family
Worth less than zero my opinion
And room temperature IQ

I did something, now I'm nothing
Always wrong with this or that
Poisoned with fear watch it twist
My measly brain mad

Solo - Pitrelli

Talk about me when my back is turned
Next time we meet it will be to late
The memory burned in my ears of what you said
And now I've got a recipe for hate. Taste it

Fill solos - Mustaine

Dark clouds on the horizon
Make it hard to breathe
A walking mistake but every time
I run away, I just come back for more

The choice is clear I can quit
And fall on my sword or light a fire
To see who runs or stays
And plays the confidence game

Solo - PitrelliAnd you see that you're all alone
When your friends they have all run out
That is when you will know I'm the one

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
'til the world explodes ('til the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (like a super collider)

This could be all the heaven you'll see
Life can be wicked, mean and cold
Could this be the end of your living hell
Come with me and I'll free your soul (hooah)

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
'til the world explodes ('til the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (like a super collider)

Just one thing that I want you to know
You don't need to be on your own
No more feeling left out in the cold
Take my hand and I'll take you home

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
'til the world explodes ('til the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (like a super collider)

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
'til the world explodes ('til the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (super collider yeah)

On the high road (like a super collider)
I will take you higher (like a super collider)
'til the world explodes (like a super collider)
Super collider!An insane place, with insane moves
Battles without, for battles within
Where evil lives and evil rules
Breaking them up, just breaking them in
Quickest way out, quickest relief wins
Never disclose, never betray
Cease to speak or cease to breathe
And when you kill a man, you're a murderer
Kill many, and you're a conqueror
Kill them all... ooh... oh, you're a god!



Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

No time for questions
No time for games
Start kicking ass
And taking down the names
A long shit list
A shorter fuse
He is untouchable
And guarantees you'll lose

Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

Inside the big house
His nightmare unfolds
Before he got there
His man-pussy was sold
Black blanket welcome
This tough guy's now a bitch
Praying for death
It can't be worse than this

Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

Captive honour, ain't no honourAll feelings have died, anyone would know it
They say those sticks and stones
They say they crush my bones
I say I don't get mad; I get even, before they do

Spoils goto the victor and dead on time
your time is going to come

One day I'll dance on you grave
Even if you're buried at sea
Till then, till when I exact my revenge
I'll tell them, "You're dead to me"

We're all just trying to hold on to innocence
You think they'd notice what we're trying to do
These wounds are invisible
Underneath the dirt I still see the scars
Back then when things got bad
And we spread our wings and fly away

You'll take all your riches in the back of a hearse
Your time is going to come

One day I'll dance on your grave
Even if you're buried at sea
Till then, till when I exact my revenge
I'll tell them, "You're dead to me"

One day I'll dance on your grave
Even if you're buried at sea
Till then, till when I exact my revenge

One day I'll dance on your grave
Even if you're buried at sea
Till then, till when I exact my revenge
I'll tell them, "You're dead to me"I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became

I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans denied

So as you read this, know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Smile when you think of me
My body's gone, that's all





These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say

Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living, all are scarred





These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

So as you read, know, my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please, smile, smile when you think about me
My body's gone, that's all





These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free





These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me freeDance of the macabre, as witches streak the sky
Decadent worship of black magic sorcery
In the womb of the Devil's Dungeon, trapped without a plea, oh

Seething in agony, necrosis is the fate
Pins sticking through the skin, the venom now sedates
Locked in a pillory, nowhere to be found
Screaming for your life, but no one hears a sound, help me!

Prepare the patient's scalp to peel away
Metal caps his ears he'll hear not what we say
Solid steel visor riveted across his eyes
Iron staples close his jaws so no one hears his cries

The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath the skin

Now you're drawn and quartered your bones will make the X
Symbol stands for poison and it's chained to your head
And as we fold your arms to make the holy cross
We cross the crucifix religion has been lost

The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath the skin

The skull beneath the skinIn the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy, hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost, the spoils of wars are yours to keep
Aw!

Great nations built from the bones of the dead with mud and straw
Blood and sweat, you know your worth
When your enemies praise your architecture of aggression
Praise your architecture of aggression

Hoo! Ensuing power vacuum
A toppled leader dies
His body fuels the power
Fire and the flames rise to the sky
One side of his face, a kiss, the other genocide
Time to pay
With your ass, a worldwide suicide

Great nations built from the bones of the dead with mud and straw
Blood and sweat, you know your worth
When your enemies praise your architecture of aggression

Born from the dark
In the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy
Hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost, the spoils of war are yours to keep

Great nations built from the bones of the dead with mud and straw
Blood and sweat, you know your worth
When your enemies praise your architecture of aggression

Great nations built from the bones of the dead with mud and straw
Blood and sweat, you know your worth
When your enemies praise your architecture of aggressionCrush, crush, crush, crush 'em
Crush, crush, crush, crush 'em
Crush, crush, crush, crush 'em
Crush, crush, crush, crush 'emSomehow you got betrayed agin
Thin ice and luck runs out
Who will you blame it on this time?

Due to lack of interest in you
The light at the end of the tunnel
Was turned off
And something I noticed
Beating you is thrilling me
I've got a secret for you

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

Don't close your eyes to injustice
Listen, being brave ain't chicken shit
A man without any valor
Has nothing worth living for

Due to lack of interest in you
The light at the end of the tunnel
Was turned off
And something I noticed
Beating you is thrilling me
I've got a secret for you

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the timeSegregating ourselves by class and size
It's me against you in everything that they do
This planet's become one big spinning disaster

If you don't like where we're going
Then you won't like what's coming next

What will we look like?
In a post American world
Why cower to all those
Who oppose the American world?

When you walk away from that which makes you strong
You only fool yourself; you only weaken your cause
There's creeping hate if you resist the false narrative
Crushing all the dissenters who still think for them selves

If you don't like where we're going
Then you won't like what's coming next

What will we look like?
In a post American world
Why cower to all those
Who oppose the American world?No one cares anymore
The messiah or mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door

A culture made of cover-ups
Will leprosy touch their flesh?
For backroom meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest

The clock runs out, the weakest link
A deadly strike, the threat is real

See the burnished images
Of a crest fallen agency
Violent conditioning
Caused the nature of the enemy

Your terminal lack of vision
Blinded eyes see no light
A chronic lack of perspective
Their cancer now eats us alive

A fatal shot, a lust for blood
The final act, the threat is real

Justified obliteration
No one cares anymore
The messiah or a mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door

A culture made of cover-ups
Will leprosy touch their flesh?
For backroom meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest

The clock runs out, the weakest link
A deadly strike, the threat is real
The final act, a lust for blood
A fatal shot, the threat is realHa! No, you're not there
And though I reached out for you
Wouldn't lend a hand
Through the darkest hour
Grace didn't shine on me
It feels so cold
Very cold, no one cares for me

Did you ever think I get lonely?
Did you ever think that I needed love ?
Did you ever think to stop thinking?
You're the only one that I'm thinking of

You'll never know
How hard I tried
To find my space and satisfy you too

Things will be better
When I'm dead and gone
Don't try to understand
Knowing you

I'm probably wrong
But, oh
How I lived my life for you
Still you'd turn away
Now
As I die for you
My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name
All these years
I thought I was wrong
Now I know it was you
Raise your head
Raise your face
Your eyes, tell me who you think you are?

I walk
I walk alone
Into the promised land
There's a better place for me
But it's far, far away

Everlasting life for me
In a perfect world
But I gotta die first
Please god send me on my way

Time has a way of taking time
Loneliness is not only felt by fools
Alone I call to ease the pain
Yearning to be held by you, alone
So alone, I'm lost consumed by the pain

The pain
The pain
The pain
Won't you hold me again?
And you just laughed, ha-ha! Bitch!
My whole life is work built on the past
But the time has come when all
Things shall pass
This good thing passed awayAs I hold you
Now gone, I miss you
But I told you
I remember bad times
More than good
There's no coming back
Even if we could

I loved you to death
I loved you to death

If I can't have you
Then no one will
And since I won't
I'll have to kill
My only love, something
I've never felt
Now you've gone to heaven
And I'll burn in hell

I loved you to death 
I loved you to death
I loved you to death
I loved you to death
Aww!

And now I'm down below
And what do I see
You didn't go to heaven
Your down here with me
And now coming back,
Baby, take me, please!
I really think I would
If you weren't such a sleaze
I loved you once before
You kept me on a string
I'd rather go without
Than take what you would bring

I loved you to death
Aww!Something you call love ()
You've been ()
And now someone else ()

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces

No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks

Well, we got no class
And we got no principles
And we got no innocence
We can't even think of a word that rhymes

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces

No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks
Out for summer
Until fall
We might not go back at all

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's out with fever
School's out completelyThe devil's henchmen, in suit and tie
A sacred brotherhood; an ancient rite
Politicians and the double lives they hide

Violate your rights, no more equality
Surrender freedom, your Social Security
We, the people face unconstitutional lies
In greed we trust, in revolution we die

Our founding fathers are rolling in their graves
The land of liberty needs a regime change
Until you no longer know right from wrong
The constitution isn't worth the paper it's written on

Violate your rights, no more equality
Surrender freedom, your Social Security
We, the people face unconstitutional lies
In greed we trust, in revolution we die

Screams from the future, warn of calamity
The coming plagues of the new disease
The illuminati, one world currency
One world religion, one World everything

Violate your rights, no more equality
Surrender freedom, your Social Security
We, the people face unconstitutional lies
In greed we trust, in revolution we die

We, the people face unconstitutional lies
In greed we trust, in revolution we dieListen, I didn't start this - believe me, I will finish it...
You called down the thunder - too late now there's no way out...
Nothing is gonna stop me - until then better watch your back...

Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!

There is no retreating - I will cut you down to size...
You will beg for mercy - a bad seed, you're as good as dead...
Yield to new dimension - Hell's coming, better say your prayers...

Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?
What do you think your fists are for?

Solo - Chris

One day you will face me - and see the terror trapped inside...
Final retribution - torture and pure punishment...
Vengeance running so deep - a dungeon of agony awaits...
Fear not as death surrounds you - Bitch all you want, but here it comes...

Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?
What do you think your fists are for?

Solo - ChrisAnd the newest slavery is to keep the people poor
And stupid; "Novus Ordo Seclorum"
How can there be any logic in biological war?
We all know this is wrong, but the New World Order's beating down the door
Oh, something needs to be done

There was a king (an evil king)
Who dreamt the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery, no prophet could interpret
Of seven years of famine
The wolf is at my door, as predicted years ago
That that was, that is, that is no more
The word predicts the future
And tells the truth about the past
Of how the world leaders will hail the new Pharaoh
The eighth false king to the throne; Washington is next!

Disengage their minds, sabotage their health
Promote sex and war, and violence in the kindergartens
Blame the parents and teachers, it's their fault; "Annuit Cœptis"
Attack the church dynamic
Attack the family, keep the public undisciplined till nothing left is sacred
And the "have-nots" get hooked and have to go to the "haves"
Just to cop a fix

I am the king (an evil king)
Who dreams the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery, nobody could interpret
Of seven empires falling
The wolf is at my door, as predicted years ago
That that was, that is, that is no more
The word predicts my future
And tells the truth about my past
Of how the world leaders are waiting to usher in
The eighth world power of modern Rome; Washington is next!

There was a king (an evil king)
Who dreamt the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery, no prophet could interpret
Of seven empires fallen
The wolf is at my door, as predicted years ago
That that was, that is, that is no more
I am a king
And I dream the wildest dreams
And nobody could interpret
Seven empires falling
The wolf is at my door
Ooh, that that was, that is, that is no more

There's something at my door
Some anciet mystery
The future tells the truth about the past
And I'm the eighth false king to the throne
I've got you in my crosshairs
Now, ain't that a bitch?
Washington...
You're next!Complete life in disarray
A simple man, power drunk
No worries of living, no more anything

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Actions progress to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the reasons that we sin?

Not one to be forgot
Spoiled rotten, so they say
Once burned, forever marked
Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Actions progress to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the reasons that we sin?

Pressure
Coming down
Down on me
Gonna break
Broken
Fingernails
Digging in
Scratch my face

Nervous
Like a cat
Gonna jump
Through my skin
Shadows
On the wall
Stretching out
Grope for me

(Reasons) Deep in me
(Reasons) Let me be
(Reasons) Let me bleed
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) The reasons that we sinWhen I said I need you
You stretched the truth
When you said that you knew
Just can't believe it
There's nothing to say
I was almost honest
Almost

Living alone
Can't stand this place
It's four in the morning
And I still see your face

I was nearly pure
When I said I loved you
You were semi-sincere
You said I'd bleed for you
We were kind of candid
Now you've gone away
You were almost honest
Almost

Living alone
Falling from grace
I want to atone
But there's just empty space
I can't face tomorrow (I can't face tomorrow)
Now you're not coming back (you're not coming back)
Walked off in the night (walked off in the night)
And just left me the tracks (and just left me the tracks)

I question the call
By the tone of your voice
I know I should hang up
But I don't have a choice

It happened that night
When you told me to go
Don't ask who's to blame
I don't know

Living alone (living alone)
Falling from grace (falling from grace)
I want to atone (I want to atone)
But there's just empty space (but there's just empty space)
I can't face tomorrow (I can't face tomorrow)
Now you're not coming back (now you're not coming back)
Walked off in the night (walked off in the night)

(Almost) Almost honest
(Almost) I was almost honest
(Almost) I was almost honest

(Almost) Almost, almost honest
(Almost) Almost honest
(Almost) Almost honestIn any shadow
Any place where danger waits to kill my time
There is one who lies and waits
To seal your fate
As sure as you live and die

Live and die
Live and die

When you feel there's something wrong
I shelter you and keep you warm
I never let you walk alone
I loved you when you still hated me
I'm coming and I won't be long
Time to reap what I have sown
Never ever let you walk alone
I know your enemy once was me

(solo - Glen)

Let me wrap my arms all around you
Suffer the trespasses that you made
I will drink your pain away
Forever and a day
If you just call out my name

If you just call
Out my name

If you just call
Even whisper it

When you feel there's something wrong
I shelter you and keep you warm
I never let you walk alone
I loved you when you still hated me
I'm coming and I won't be long
It's time to reap what I have sown
Never ever let you walk alone
I know your enemy once was me

OhhhYou're drifting and ya don't believe in anyone 
To lose what little you have left to be proud of 
Afraid you can't do this again, ah! 

You said that nothing come in-between us 
The way of getting things we wanted done 
Then enissophobia held you under its influence 
Until you compromised your style 

Everything about you has been one big charade 
What will you do now that the well's run dry? Cry? 
To sell out all your friends and stab them in the back 
It's something that you are; it's something that I'm not 

When you forced me into doing what you love 
Mark my words no one loves you very much, yeah mark em' 
And when you tried to change me and tried to replace me 
I couldn't help but end just hating you, hmm! 

Being a fraud can only last so long, you should know 
Till what ya sensed as a child returns, you little baby 
To choke out the voice that told ya "money and the fame"
Would fill the crater that you dug for yourself 

Unlike you I'm no vision to myself, lest you forget 
You didn't ever make metal, buddy; metal made you 
To crush and run over everyone along the way 
It's something that you are; it's something that I'm not 

A stranger to yourself, ha! ya pissed me off again 
I won't be driven by your needs anymore 
What you'd become to do or be is clear to see for me 
It's something that you are; something that I'm not 

It makes me sick to hear you say you "love me"
I know you only love what I can do for you 
If you were the one that was leading the charge 
Would you notice if I missed a day or two? But that's impossible! 

We all laughed at the parodies that you'd become 
Now your pain slowly paid back has begun 
So, accept my resignation, or in your words "betrayal"
Before it gets much worse, end this self-sabotage 

Something that I'm not, something that you are, something I'm not 

Something that I'm not, something that you are, something I'm not 
Something that you are, something I'm not, yetTo dominate and kill
A glistening murder machine
False majesty standing perfectly still
A blitzkrieg raining down evil
On a mountain of black ice
Like a good old fashioned beating within
Inches of your life

While alone and left abandoned
With the sentence you've been handed
All your angels will ignore you
As your life flashes before you
Even still you keep on fighting
Through the thunder and the lightning
And now Heaven sends its love
Your sudden death from above

Once frozen like a prisoner depraved
Perched high atop the lithosphere
Set free from beneath the depths of hell
Bequeathing anything but despair
The beast is genetically programmed
Time to destroy, time to go berserk
To see the end of all wars
To see the end of the Earth

Stopping at nothing, punch drunk
From the blood that he's tasted
Tearing your soul apart
Not one bit of your pain will be wasted
Now death descends upon you
Like a bloody white dove
Bringing your retribution
Your sudden death from above

While alone and left abandoned
With the sentence you've been handed
All your angels will ignore you
As your life flashes before you
Even still you keep on fighting
Through the thunder and the lightning
And now Heaven sends its love
Your sudden death from aboveAnd blindfolded her so she can't see
The erosion of the people's trust
Of what will come to be an FDIC assisted suicide

The depression of a depression
Worldwide suicide for the economy
Caused by the dialectic chaos when the mob on Wall Street
Took "We the people" for a ride

When it's dog eat dog, you are what you eat
Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
Like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds

They took everything and anything
As long as it once belonged to me
The rats got all the money
The roaches licked the cupboards clean of TV dinners and beer

This never-ending nightmare
Of the dreams I'll never, ever get to see
And just one silver bullet to your head
It will set me free from all the life I wasted trusting you

When it's dog eat dog, you are what you eat
Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
Like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
When it's dog eat dog, you are what you eat
Like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
Just like the mad dog you bite the hand that feedsLeading me unfulfilled
Promising compromise
Championing mediocrity

Time and time again
What you said ain't what you mean
Even if all my bones are broken
I will drag myself back from the edge to

Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
I am the king, God save the king

Kill the king, the king is dead, I am the king, long live the king
Kill the king, the king is dead, I am the king, long live the king

I reveal a deceiver
In the highest seat in the land
His idle hands the devil's workshop
Generate more smoke than heat

Time and time again
What you said ain't what you mean
Even if all my bones are broken
I will drag myself back from the edge to

Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
I am the king, God save the king

A new precedent in pain, a new precedent in pain
Mankind is blown to dust, mankind is blown to dust
An explosion of the brain, an explosion of the brain
Spontaneously combust, spontaneously combust

Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
I am the king

Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
I am the king

Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
I am the king

Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
I am the kingAnd we pay for the machine you're feeding
You can never shut up, you can never shut down
This house divided

We all know, we all know, something's wrong, we all know

Something's wrong about the way you're thinking
The rats are jumping, and your ship is sinking
You can never get on, you can never get off
This house divided...

We all hear about the case you're pleading
Your demands have gone beyond conceding
You can never get in, you can never get out
This house divided...

This is a sad day for violence
When speech results in silence
I'm supposed to hate you
You're supposed to hate me
We can never agree

Solo - Chris

Now we've become so desperate
Don't you forget you asked for it!
I'm supposed to hate you
You're supposed to hate me
We never agree

Solo - Chris

Solo - Dave

We all know about the hate you're breeding
And we pay for the machine you're feeding
A house divided...Nothing's what it seems
Searching my head
For the words that you said

Tears filled my eyes (eyes)
As we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays
Of you walking away

Me duele todo el cuerpo por los errores
Traisionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que en nada confiamos

Time and again
She repeats, "Let's be friends"
I smile and say yes
Another truth bent
I must confess

I try to let go, but I know
We'll never end till we're dust
We lied to each other again (but I wish I could trust)
But I wish I could trust

Me duele todo el cuerpo por los errores
Traisionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que en nada confiamos

Dios te lo pido de rodillas
Ayudame por favor
Traisionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que en nada confiamos

Como pudo sucederme esto a mi
Miento cuando digo confia en mi
No puedo creer que esto sea verdad
La confianza duele
Porque la confianza es igual a sufrimiento (sufrimiento)

Me duele todo el cuerpo por los errores
Traisionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que en nada confiamos

Dios te lo pido de rodillas
Ayudame por favor
Traisionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que en nada confiamos

Me duele todo el cuerpo por los errores
Traisionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno...

No confiamos absolutamente en nadaUnder the stars and the moon
Sounds of galloping horses
On clouds of lightning and thunder

A dark gathering storm
To scorch the earth for many generations
A nuclear winter
Worse than any cold or holy war

A white horse on the clouds of death
A red warhorse to end all wars
A pale horse and pestilence led by a
Black horse with famine and scales

The doctrine of hatred
Nation will rise against nation
Wash me in blood and let me be
The firstborn of the dead

A crowned rider with arrows and bow
A red rider with a great firey sword
Flames come from the one called death
Horror and apocalypse follows

(RIDE!) Won't you four horsemen ride again
Before this kingdom is blown to kingdom come

I hold fast to what I believe
Till I see my name in stone

Blessed are the dead

A white horse on the clouds of death
A red warhorse to end all wars
A pale horse and pestilence led by a
Black horse with famine and scales

The synagogue of satan
Nation will rise against nation
Wash me in blood and let me be
The firstborn of the dead

A crowned rider with arrows and bow
A red rider with a great firey sword
Flames come from the one called death
Horror and apocalypse follows

(RIDE!) Won't you four horsemen ride again
Before this kingdom is blown to kingdom come
I hold fast to what I believe
Till I see my name in stone

Blessed are the deadAnd nothing costs as much as playing the game
She had to know, know, know... he'd give love for sex
He had to know, know, know... she'd give sex for love

The taste, touching his tongue, sweet to his lips
Poison, now penetrating deeper
Betrayed by just one bite, for just one night
To find forbidden fruit tastes sweeter

Just like pressing a loaded gun to your head
One knows only the spider can navigate its web
She had to know, know, know... he'd get what he wants
He had to know, know, know... she'd get what she needs

Soon under the spell, emotions are high
Mind control penetrating deeper
The hex was cast on him, all he believes
Now is forbidden fruit tastes sweeter

She had to know, know, know... he'd win at the start
He had to know, know, know... she'd win in the end

His one last thought blew his mind, bullet to the brain
Hot lead was penetrating deeper
Just one reckless shot squeezed from the hand
That knows forbidden fruit tastes sweeterShot in cold blood, no chance to fight
The stage is set, now pay the price
An ego boost, don't think twice
Technology, the battle's unfair
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you man
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned...
The hunt is canned

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction

Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare
The skin and trophy, oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt, and take your turn
Liars anagram is "lairs"
Man, you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank, you're so courageous...
So courageous

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction

One hour from now
Another species of life form
Will disappear off the face of the planet
Forever...and the rate is accelerating

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinctionWhen Cain struck down Abel, a family broken 
Since then mankind's dominated his own kind 
To insult and injure, there's no such thing as peace 
Till death do us part, till the last 

Truth be told - Sin lies at the doorway 
Truth be told - Hell's open for business now 
Truth be told - The soil cries out for revenge 
Truth be told - And death is upon the ground 
All around 

The battle ain't over without spoils of war 
Just cause it is written does not make it so 
When you dance with the devil wait till the song's over 
I ask myself, how bad do I want you to live?' 
My anger is near, till the last 

Truth be told - Sin lies at the doorway 
Truth be told - Hell's open for business now 
Truth be told - The soil cries out for revenge 
Truth be told - And death is upon the ground 
All around 

Tribulation strikes and we're hit hard 
Still you just go on your way 
Head in the sand, ignoring the rain 
Just like the flood in Noah's day 
In his day 

Can't punish those ruining the earth 
It's suicide to some degree 
Because we are all guilty, guilty as sin 
There will be no peace, never for you and for me 

Before al Qaeda and Bin Laden 
Long before Hitler and Hussein 
Ever since the first murder was committed 
The verdict's always been the same 

The cursed future just repeats the past 
There's hell to pay and stones to cast 
So, there will be no peace, never be peace 
Till the last truth be told by you and meStand up, plant your feet
Listen, I'm letting off steam
Now throw your hands in the air
Let it loose, I don't fucking care

Rattlehead

A dose of metal you need
To bang your head till you bleed
It's time for snapping some neck
Slashing, thrashing to Megadeth

Rattlehead

You, your head is pounding with pain
You shake loose parts of your brain
Winning, sinning, beginning
Feeding, the needing for bleeding
Bashing, smashing, crashing
Frying, annihilating you!

There's someone back in the shadows
You can't see his eyes
He'll bash your head if you cross him
Ain't quite your average guy
Don't wear no leather to "fit in"
Don't wear no spikes to be "cool"
Don't want no woman beside him
Just make it fast, loud and rude

Rattlehead

I'm a rattlehead
Rattle your goddamn head!Get it right, terminate them
The Panzers will, permeate them
Break their pride, denigrate them
And their people, retrograde them
Typhus, deteriate them
Epidemic, devastate them
Take no prisoners, cremate them

Going to war, give 'em hell
D-Day, next stop Normandie
Beginning of the end
WE know how to and sure as shit we'll win
War is peace sure man
A retreat for the damned
A playground for the demented
A haven for those who walk this world
Bereft of heart and soul
Love and war they say all is fair
Take his life
But won't take his hair
Your body has parts your
Country can spare
By the way son here's
Your wheelchair

He once had to be all he could be
Now he's nothing for no one nowhere to see
Funny thing, he's like you & me
It's a funny thing, a funny thing
Tears streak his solemn stare
Abandoned for wreckage nobody cares
No one knew what would happen there
No one spoke no one even dared
Don't ask what you can do for you country
Ask what your country can do for you
Take no prisoners, take no shitNo one will ever miss a menace to society
A gross lack of potential, bad decisions made in spite
A touchy hairpin trigger and such a wasted life

Trying to break the mold of a broken family
Fighting damn sure failure, and living on his knees
Guilty of the crime of nonconformity
A hanging judge and jury handing down the penalty

A lethal injection, now they watch the body jerk
Exterminate the problem, except it didn’t work

No vital sign of life, they declared it wasn’t there
Coroner never checked, because he didn’t fucking care
Passing off the body, they all believe he died
Starting up the hearse, set out for a final drive

Like whistling past a graveyard, when walking by at night
It’s a fatal illusion to think that evil ever dies

In a darkened mortuary, reeking of formaldehyde
Aroused from deadly slumber, something opened up his eyes

Spilling all their blood was a promise that he’d keep
Hate so strong revived him from a deep necrotic sleep

Clawing away the casket lid until his fingers bleed
He grabbed a knife and set out on a vivisection spree

A butcher, hell bent, massacring each one with his blade
From the first one to the last, he dispatched them to the grave

It’s a fatal illusion…

Evil never dies
It never diesPersecuting their 'own kind', there's nothing you can say
Don't ask anyone for help, they won't know what to do
If you try, if you don't die, you'll end up black and blue

Epidemic of addiction, worshipping the pill
Drown them all with alcohol, anything for thrills
Precious life goes up in smoke, going nowhere fast
The world is running rampant and you know that this can't last

I want everything that makes me feel alright
That feels alive, don't ask me why
I want everything, right before my eyes
I can't deny I want to be the King!
Kingmaker!

Searching for an answer, but you see you're all alone
Mom and Daddy's lights are on but nobody's home
They glorify their tortured life; they talk of days like this
Sentencing their children, when they need to eat a fist

Narcotics have enslaved them; now it's coming after you
Pearl of wisdom hit the floor, there's nothing you can do
Out of control, you sell your soul, so blind, you couldn't see
Ten feet tall, it made you crawl; it's better you than me

I want everything that makes me feel alright
That feels alive, don't ask me why
I want everything, right before my eyes
I can't deny I want to be the King!
Kingmaker!

I want everything that makes me feel alright
That feels alive, don't ask me why
I want everything, right before my eyes
I can't deny I want to be the King!
It makes me feel alive, I want everything
It makes me feel alright, I want everything
The things I can't deny, I want everything
I want to be the King!Ain't got no smoke
Ain't got a car
His life's a joke

Living on the skids
Thinks the world's just fine
Forgot what he did
Dancing on the breadline

No one there to bind him
Nothing to remind him
Nowhere left to find him

About to lose his lifeline
He's dancing on the breadline

Forgot who he is
Forgot who he was
Used to call the shots
Now he can't connect the dots

A mover and shaker
Getting closer to his maker
Lower than a hemline
Dancing on the breadline

No one there to bind him
Nothing to remind him
Nowhere left to find him

About to lose his lifeline
He's looking for a headline
Sniffing up the white lines
He's dancing on the breadline

Watch him dance

About to lose his lifeline
He's looking for a headline
Sniffing up the white lines
He's dancing on the breadline
About to lose his lifeline
He's dancing on the breadline

No one, nothing, nowhere
Dancing on the breadline

He forgot and he ain't got nothingShe was shooting pool with friends
I sent someone over and
I watched her shake her head, she said

If I wanted to meet her
I had to come at least that far
Introduced myself to a look that would kill
She sneered, "I know who you are"
Oh yeah, that's right, climb on and hold tight
She is all I want in a girl

Solo - Dave

We took off on a rocket ride
It felt like it would never end
I started moving in on over
And I watched her tilt her head, she said

If I'm gonna lay it on her, it'd better
Be more than just tonight
At that moment I knew after I kissed you
I've known you all my life, she said

Oh yeah, that's right, climb on and hold tight
She is all I want in a girl
Oh yeah, that's right, I like that she's all spice
I am all she wants in my girl

Solo - Chris

All I want, all I need, all I want, all that I need...

All I want in a girl, she is all that... I want

All I want, all I need, all I want, all that I need...

She is all that I wantYou just won't need them anymore
And your mind is ours to do with what we please
Everything you own and everything you need

Sacrifice you leaders; like it or not
Or else you're going down with the ship; death on the rocks

Blind follow; blind lead
All our hopes and dreams, washed out to sea

All your money's ours to bankroll corrupt wars
You can't see what you're fighting for
Trust your leaders as they send you out to die
The true face of evil can't be seen without eyes

Sacrifice you leaders; like it or not
Or else you're going down with the ship; death on the rocks

Blind follow; blind lead
All our hopes and dreams, washed out to sea

At the start of time; many centuries ago
Came the spawning of Christ and the Antichrist
And darkness fell upon our people
And the children, they were born faceless
Without eyes they could not see
Born unto themselves; they lived and they died
In the Millennium of the Blind

Blind follow; blind lead
All our hopes and dreams, washed out to seaIn a mire of hypocrisy, ignores sex crimes by its blue helmets, and enables terrorism, so in the end, it has failed. And the UN is where our so-called friends get to stab us in the back, and we pay 22% of their tab to host our enemies here at home.

Ambassadors from countries otherwise known as "The Catastrophe" enjoy Diplomatic immunity, living in Manhattan, while their children are turned into prostitutes. It's a complete and utter disgrace! A blot on the face of humanity! And they get away with it!?!

Poverty in their kitchens
Held hostage by oil-for-food
Yet their own plates are full off the fat of their lands
There's no blood on their hands, right Gojo?
They promised to tell the truth
Without leaving a fingerprint.
They will lose the UN one way or another.
The victim, I fear will be us, sisters and brothers!

The UN is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now, the UN is undone.
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun.
The threat is real, the Locust King has come.
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done.
It's payback time, at the United Abominations.

A grave and gathering danger
The decision to attack
Based on secret intelligence, it'll take years
I fear to undo the failings in Iraq.
You may bury the bodies
But you can't bury the crimes.
Only fools stand up and really lay down their arms
No, not me, not when Death lasts forever

The UN is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now, the UN is undone.
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun.
The threat is real, the Locust King has come.
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done.
It's payback time.

NATO invaded Yugoslavia to end ethnic cleansing, there was no UN.
The US invaded Afghanistan after 9/11, there was no UN.
Saddam Hussein violated 17 UN resolutions; The UN was asked to join the war in Iraq. The US invaded, there was no UN.
Libya bombed a discotheque in Berlin killing Americans, there was no UN.
Iran funds a mosque, and attacked the US in the seventies, there was no UN.
Facing war, without end, looking into the future.
There...was...no...more...UN!

Psychotron!Nothing's what it seems
Searching my head
For the words that you said

Tears filled my eyes (eyes)
As we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays
Of you walking away

My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust

Time and again
She repeats let's be friends
I smile and say yes
Another truth bent
I must confess

I try to let go, but I know
We'll never end 'till we're dust
We lied to each other again (but I wish I could trust)
But I wish I could trust

My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust (in nothing we trust)

God help me please, on my knees (on my knees)
Betrayed by lust (by lust)
We lied to each other so much (so much)
Now there's nothing we trust

How could this be happening to me?
I'm lying when I say 'trust me'
I can't believe this is true
Trust hurts
Why does trust equal suffering?
Suffering

My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust (in nothing we trust)

God help me please, on my knees
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much (so much)
Now there's nothing we trust (nothing we trust)

My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust (by lust)
We lied to each other so much (lied to each other so much)
That in nothing we trust

God help me please (help me please), on my knees
Betrayed by lust (lust)
We lied to each other so much
Absolutely nothing we trust!Mi nominee baphomet, come dance with me
Sacrifice the virgins, spiritual rites
Their master's time has come, the moon is full tonight

Drinking, dancing, they worship and toast
The devil, who's watching with demon's remote
Fire, rising, racing in your blood
Possessed, naive, his service is done

It's the Sabbath
Bloody Sabbath
Bad omen of the goat

Bloody blasphemy

Sinister's the word as the demon's take their fill
An orgy's taking place human blood will spill
An act of worship as they conceive the ghouls
Satan has their souls they sing pagan tunes

The ceremony is sure to be cursed
They wait for his blessings, but down comes the worst
Their bodies, soulless a corpse from the grave
Their minds are helpless and no one can save

No one can save
No one can save
No one can save, no one can know
No one can save, no one can knowFirst time you touched me
Secure and safe in open arms
I should have known you'd crush me

A snake you were when we met
I loved you anyway
Pulling out your poisoned fangs
The venom never goes away

Serpent swims free in my blood
Dragons sleeping in my veins
Jackal speaking with tongue
Roach egg laying in my brain

Once stalked beneath your shadow
Sleepwalking to the gallows
I'm the sun that beats your brow in
'Til I finally threw the towel in

Never knowing if I'd wake up
In a whirlpool got redundant
My brain was just some driftwood
In a cesspool, I became dead

From a rock star to a desk fool
Was my destiny, someone said
Loves a tidepool
Taste the waters
Life's abundant
Taste meTrapped in a dingy corporate cubicle hell
Then go to work in the darkness on the midnight shift
Any chance you get, selling gas at the corner Shell

Three letters groups listening in on you
Under surveillance courtesy of Big Brother in your car
Drones monitor each and every move you make
It doesn't matter who you know or who you think you are

You'll never see a ray of daylight
So far in debt you're struggling to survive
But you will break your back fighting and they'll help
Before you let them break your pride

"Powers that be" will never win; a storm is coming, get ready
You better learn to dance in the rain, instead of wait for the sun
Learn to dance in the rain, the sun will never come

Solo - Dave

Down on your luck, you had your hand out once or twice
But all you wanted was just a hand, they say
"You have the right to remain silent", so shut your mouth
Don't mention the broken promises and lies of hope and change

"Powers that be" will never win; a storm is coming, get ready
You better learn to dance in the rain, instead of wait for the sun
Learn to dance in the rain, the sun will never come

Solo - Chris

Never come, dance in the rain, it ain't gonna come

Solo - Dave

Enslave and impoverish the middle class
Make them dependent then strip it all away
Al-CIA-da, destruction, and democide
Addiction, corruption, every word's a lie

Races, classes, sexes, religious wars
Destroy the family, and what love is for

The Fed and the Bankers own all the politicians
May I introduce you to the sons of perdition?
Replace the dictators Washington appointed
The Devil Messiahs and the dangerously disappointed

They lie to themselves, pleased with what they've done
Soon they all will be repaid and there's nowhere to runOne hundred and one shots of opportunity, I'd gladly take them all again and again, and again

My angel's left me, sorrows are my own
Now I'm here, with the Devil on my own
Just like a churchyard shadow, creeping after me
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me

I promised on my soul, not to get carried away
It always starts out psychedelic, and then it turns to black
My head starts swaying, I forgot what it was that I was saying
I don't know where I am, and I'll never, never make it back

I sealed my fate, and I paid my debt
I fell from grace with deep regret

My angel's left me, sorrows are my own
And now I'm here, with the Devil on my own
Just like a churchyard shadow, creeping after me
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me
Just like a churchyard shadow, there's nothing left to see
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me

My angel's left me, sorrows are my own
Now I'm here, with the Devil on my own, on my own
Just like a churchyard shadow, creeping after me
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me
Just like a churchyard shadow, there's nothing left to see
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me

Just like a churchyard shadow, creeping after me
There's nothing left to see, There's nothing left of meWe'd be going anywhere telling people
How to live?
Who'd believe we'd spend more
Shippin' drugs and guns
Than to educate our sons?
Sorry but that's what they did

I can't help but think
I can't help but think
I can't help but think
Someone's forsaken you and me

Luck deserted me and the truth
Beat out my brains
Men rise on stepping stones of their
Selves to higher things
I've stepped over lots of bodies on my way
Thanks for the information
Don't need no more anything

I can't help but think
I can't help but think
I can't help but think
Someone's forsaken you and me

We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We've been hung out to dry
You didn't want us anyway
And now we're making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives
We run for youthanasia

We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We've been hung out to dry
You didn't want us anyway
And now we're making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives
We run for youthanasia

We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We run for youthanasiaAs I'm taking all your money
I guess I should feel sorry
But I don't even trust me
There's bad news creeping up
And you feel a sudden chill
How do you do? My name is Trouble
I'm coming in for the kill...
In for the kill
And you know I will

Set the ball a-rollin'
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life o' style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There ain't no turning back

No horse ever ran as fast
As the money that you bet
I'm blowing all my cards
And I play them to my chest
Life's fabric is corrupt
Shot through with corroded thread
As for me I hocked my brains
Packed my bag and headed West
I hocked my brains
Headed West

Set the ball a-rollin'
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life o' style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There ain't no turning backCome get inside my head
Ooh the war of words
You're underneath my skin

You hate the way I wear my clothes
You hate my friends and where we go
I see you in the shadows
You think you know what's best for me
You hate everything you see in me
Have you looked in the mirror?

Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
Got so much more than theprice
I ain't gonna pay

You only point out fault
An anxiety attack
You're running you mouth
You stab me in my back

You hate the way I wear my clothes
You hate my friends and where we go
I see you in the shadows
You think you know what's best for me
You hate everything you see in me
Have you looked in the mirror?

Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
Got so much more than the price
I ain't gonna pay

Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
Got so much more than the price
I ain't gonna pay

Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?White knuckles grasp at the wheel
I rush from an avalanche of adrenaline
It's all that I feel

As quick as a bolt of lightning
A rocket ride in a bucket seat
It doesn't get any better than this
It just feeds my need for speed

Supercharged, strapped in and screaming
Fire spitting from the pipes
A burnout by the flame-throwing fury
Eight thousand horses ignite
Full throttle, hit the ground running
With a tank full of nitro
And it's thirteen-twenty to go to the finish line

My hands hold tight
A fire breathing stampede
I fall into a trance
Hold my breath till the light turns green

In a cloud of nitro methane
Melting rubber, I say my prayers
Man and machine accelerate
When I vanish in thin air

Supercharged, strapped in and screaming
Fire spitting from the pipes
A burnout by the flame-throwing fury
Eight thousand horses ignite
Full throttle, hit the ground running
With a tank full of nitro
And it's thirteen-twenty to go to the finish lineDependability, made me a nervous wreck
Accountability, I live from check to check
Volatility, neglect and no respect

Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat
I hit the road to "I don't know" and look for "Tough Shit Street"

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho
Going nowhere everybody is a
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho
Moto Psycho

You know you can't resist to tell me what I mean
You gave my mind a twist said that I was unclean
The actor runs the play and ad-libs in between
You're all that I resent my thoughts were so obscene

Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat
I hit the road to "I don't know" and look for "Tough Shit Street"

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho
Going nowhere everybody is a
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho
Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho
Going nowhere move it or lose it baby Moto Psycho
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour Moto Psycho
Where I'm headed I don't know but I'm shoving off and I hit the road
Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho - time and time and time again I'm a
Moto Psycho
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto PsychoThe one that ends it all
Hanging up, I wanted to cry
But dammit, this well's gone dry
Not for the money, not for the fame
Not for the power, just no more games

But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
I can't replace the lies, that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside
In her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

You'll grow to loathe my name
You'll hate me just the same
You won't need your breath
And soon you'll meet your death
Not from the years, not from the use
Not from the tears, just self abuse

But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
I can't replace the lies, that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside
In her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

Who's to say, what's for me to say?
Who's to say, what's for me to be?
Who's to say, what's for me to do?
Cause a big nothing it'll be for me

The land of opportunity
The golden chance for me
My future looks so bright
Now I think I've seen the light

Can't say what's on my mind
Can't do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
Is where I sleep, I really feel

I warn you of the fate
Proven true too late
Your tongue twist perverse
Come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain
I spin you round again
My poison fills your head
As I tuck you into bed

You feel my fingertips
You won't forget my lips
You'll feel my cold breath
It's the kiss of deathTo draw my thoughts, I'll gather and tell
Like bricks that I've laid to build my life
Those that crumbled only caused me strife

Thoughts became words, cast into the sea
But they returned, always haunting me
Like a severed arm washed up on the shore
I just don't think I can give anymore

Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?
Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
After everything, you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

At thirteen I started down this path
Fueled with anger, music was my wrath
Years of clawing at scars that never healed
Drowning my mind, the thoughts are too real

Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?
Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
After everything, you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

I can't get out; I can't jump out
Too much to face; I can't erase

Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?
Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
After everything, you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

I can't get out; I can't jump out
Too much to face; I can't erase

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for meSomething's haunting me
The guilty past I've buried
My mind won't let me sleep

I'll do anything for peace - I keep waking up
A solemn oath I make
Cross my heart, please let me sleep - I keep waking up
How much more do I take

My head is talking to me
I don't know what it needs
But the loudest voice
Is the one I heed

Insomnia, my swollen bloodshot eyes
Insomnia, awake 'til morning light
Insomnia, stirring deep inside
Insomnia, somebody turn out the lights
I can't sleep - insomnia

I'm twisting and turning - I keep waking up
The madness I must tame
My candle is burning - I keep waking up
Both ends again today

The whole house is creaking
I know they're out there
The things kept from sight
I beg to the shadows
I can't sleep

Insomnia, footsteps on the walk
Insomnia, I hear someone knock
Insomnia, I wish it was a dream
Insomnia, can you hear me screamDream up your pain
Drink as did bacchus
Rebel just like cain 
Lord of the city
I shall remain 
All pandemonium
I shall reign 
Set in my fortress
Up on my hill 
Drinking the wine
Till I've had my fill 
Building up high
My castle walls 
Oh to veil my splendid fall 

I present you, I present to you
I present you, this crown of worms (2x)

Surrounding myself with misery
Drawn curtains heavy of my history
Exquisite I am perfect unity
On my left hand is false majesty
I feign affection, refute the true story 
Dispute with creation, the lie is my glory 
I care for no-one, my gospel is death 
For me the lights gone, only darkness is left 

I present you, I present to you
I present you, this crown of worms (2x)

As black in deed
As cold as stone
A commandment of one
As proud as gold 
As neglected in spirit
As time is old
As legion is numbers
As legend is told 
I am alone with the agony of truth 
My power of will
My judgement and chain
My end is knowledge 
And conscience of guilt
My final confusion hidden from me til I'm donePeople think that I'm insane because I'm frowning all the time

All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me?
Occupy my brain
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh, and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel, so love to me is so unreal

And so, as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could, but it's too late
It's too late
Too late

Dave: 
Nick:Get it right, terminate them
The Panzers will, permeate them
Break their pride, denigrate them
And their people, retrograde them
Typhus, deteriate them
Epidemic, devastate them
Take no prisoners, cremate them

Burn!

Going to war, give'em hell
D-Day, next stop - Normandy
Beginning of the end
We know how to and sure as shit we'll win
War is peace, sure man
A retreat for the damned
A playground for the demented
A haven for those who walk his world
Bereft of heart and soul

Love and war, they say all is fair
Take his life , but won't take his hair
Your body has parts your
Country can spare
By the way son here's
Your wheelchair

He once had to be
All he could be
Now he's nothing for no one nowhere to see
Funny thing, he's like you and me
It's funny thing, a funny thing
Tears streak
His solemn stare
Abandoned for wreckage nobody cares
No one knew what would happen there
No one spoke, no one even dared
Don't ask what you can do for your country
Ask what your country can do for you

Take no prisoners, take no shitI cause millions of accidents, I am cancer in your bones
I fathered the lie, twist what you say, speak not the truth
I am insidious, impartial, deep inside your chromosomes

I take what you love, and leave you in tears
I imprison your soul, your hopes are my games
I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain
While you burn at the stake, I dance with the flames

I bring poverty, sickness and death
A worthless handshake, the slickest thief, I steal your wealth
I answer your prayers for greed and lust
More than evil, I laugh at your trust

I am more powerful than all the armies of the world
I am more violent than violence, more deadly than death
I have destroyed more men than all the nation's wars
I am relentless, unpredictable, waiting for your last breath

(Evil) More evil than violence
(Violent) More violent than death
(Deadly) More deadly than man
(I am) Yeah yeah, I'm evil, I am

My kingdom corrupt with dissent
Your sins erupt by my intent
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin
Let the nightmare begin
Prince of darkness, your satanic highness
Prince of darkness, the devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness

I take what you love, and leave you in tears (leave you, in tears)
Imprison your soul, your hopes are my games (your hopes, my games)
I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain (promise, in vain)
While you burn at the stake (at the stake, at the stake) I dance with the flames

My kingdom corrupt with dissent
Your sins erupt by my intent
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin
Let the nightmare begin
Prince of darkness, your satanic highness
Prince of darkness, the devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness

Prince of darkness, your satanic highness
Prince of darkness, the most beautiful angel
Prince of darkness, the devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness, unpredictable, the prince of darkness
Prince of darknessMy life is standing still
It's clear that fate is closing in
But this is the life I choose
I've got so much time to kill
Born to lose, I'll die to win

Burn, baby burn... 'cause it feels so good

I'm getting on my own nerves
And I get no satisfaction
Till I light it up and burn it down
One match lights my fire
And it starts a chain reaction
That burns my crooked past to the ground

Burn, baby burn... 'cause it feels so good
Burn, baby burn... like I knew it would
Fire, I've got the fire
Fire, burning desire... my desire to burn

Solo - Dave

I hear the darkness call
The sirens are growing near
It's time I make my great escape
The flames are getting tall
Inside my rear view mirror
Just a spark is all it takesHey, I don't feel so good
Something's not right
Something's coming over me
What the fuck is this?
Whoa

Killer, intruder, homicidal man
You see me coming, run fast as you can
A bloodthirsty demon is stalking the street
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat
Bloodthirsty demon, sinister fiend
Bludgeonous slaughters, my evil deed

My hammer's a cold piece of blood-lethal steel
I grin while you writhe with the pain that I deal
Swinging the hammer, I hack through their heads
Defiant defilers, you're next to be dead
I unleash my hammer with sadistic intent
Pounding, surrounding, slamming through your head, yeah

The bodies convulse in agony and pain
I mangle their faces till no features remain
A blade for the butchering, I cut them to shreds
First take out the organs, then cut off the head
Remains of flesh now sop under my feet
One more bloody massacre, the murder's complete
I seek to dismember a sadist fiend
Bloodbaths are my way of getting clean
I lurk in the alley, wait for the kill
I have no remorse for the blood that I spill

A merciless butcher that lives underground
I'm out to destroy and I will cut you down
Cut you down
I see you and I'm waiting for Black Friday

Cut me loose
Killer, intruder, homicidal man
If you see me coming, run fast as you can
A bloodthirsty demon who's stalking the street
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat
Bloodthirsty demon, sinister fiend
Bludgeonous slaughters, my evil deed

A merciless butcher who lives underground
I'm out to destroy and I will cut you down

It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the, devil on the, devil on the wallDon't come to join with me
For Death surely wants you
With sharp and pointy teeth

An animal so vicious
No others fought and won
So on the fields of battle
We are the chosen ones

Human bones blanket the dirt
Of the heathen's lair
That we must pass this den of death
The only path from here

But I walk in the light
The time to die has come
No one shall take my life
I'm of the chosen ones

Black shadows fill the sky
As the creatures eyes grow near
Raise the shield of the holy pilgrims
High into the air

Heaven's powers fill my arms
Onward now to fight I'm sent
Oh the beast is coming
To put you to the test

Look out!
Now this land is mine to pillage
Rape, and steal, and take at will
Never let you cross this path
I reign, for now, I stay to kill

You doubt your strength or courage
Don't come to join with me
For Death surely wants you
With sharp and pointy teeth

An animal so vicious
No others fought and won
So on the fields of battle
We are the chosen onesI pray the lord my soul to keep
If I should die (just) before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take

I'm not going to wake up today
They've pulled my plug, the picture fades
And as my body decays
Mold begins to fill my grave
The smell of death permeates
The silk within my coffin lays

Go to hell!

As they bury me now
Six feet, there my body lies
Still feel like I'm going down
I hear a distant wailing cry
God, something must have gone wrong!
Much too late, I realize

Go to hell!

I saw my funeral that day
I know who didn't show to mourn
My judgment was life in hell
Pillars of pain and thorns
My only friends the goat
With 666 between his horns

Go to hell!

Place all your trust here in me
Rest assured these things I know
And as Charon sails the sea
Your journey, too shallow below
Ah yes! You're all sitting ducks
It's true - you reap what you sow

Go to hell!

Now I lay me down to sleep
Blah blah blah, my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
I'll go to hell for heaven's sake!That I got for you
Is the one thing
That you never do

One thing makes you feel brand new
Is the one thing that you're coming to
Just the one thing
Gets you in the mood

You call my number in the middle of the night
To tell me nothing else can make you feel all right
But it rings and rings, you hang it up
And call me back again

One thing
That I got for you
Is the one thing
That you never do

One thing
That you got to choose
Is the one thing you can never lose
Just the one thing is your attitude

You call my name in the middle of the night
When you're makin' love and it feels all right
But it's him, not me
Can't you see a shot of reality?

I know what you do
I know what you want to do
I know when the lights go out
I know what you are gonna do

One thing
That I got for you
Is the one thing
That you never do

Just the one thing gets you in the mood
Just the one thing, it's your attitude
One thing is one thing
Just the one thing
OhCold as hell, black as spades, aware of my immediate surroundings
In my place, I escape up into my hideout
Hiding from everyone, my friends all say, "Dave, you're mental anyway, hey"
Drift into a deeper state, stalk the cobwebbed stairways
Dirt grits beneath my feet, the stair creaks, I precariously sneak, yeah

Hypnosis guides my hand, I slip-slide through the walkways
Sit in granny's rocking chair, memories are whirling by, yeah
Reminiscin' in the attic, Lucretia waits impatiently
Cobwebs make me squint, the cobra so eloquently glints
Moonbeams surge through the sky, the crystal ball is energized
Surely that, like the cat, waiting, Lucretia rocks away, heyAnd put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch peoples heads a'roll
A'roll, a'roll

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swayin' to the symphony
Of destruction

Actin' like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes, explodes

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swayin' to the symphony
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swayin' to the symphony
Swayin' to the symphony
Of destruction

The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
Oh warrin' for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
A'tall, a'tall

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swayin' to the symphony
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swayin' to the symphony
Swayin' to the symphony
Of destructionTake control, untouchable just like God above
I can't escape, wrapped in red tape, what will become of me?
If I object, then I defect, my country 'tis of thee

The White House is calling
Tell them I'll call them back
Just tell them anything
Yeah, get them off my back

The world needs a hero

Not that I would ever lie but I have no choice
Words I say heard today are not mine, just my voice

NATO is on line one
They want to talk to me
Tell them that I'm not in
Tell them that I'm not free

The world needs a hero

Phantom rule, the hidden jewel
Who's really in control?
On puppet strings, a nation swings
Undermined by moles

The UN is on hold
Tell them I'll call them back
Yeah, tell them anything
Just get them off my back

The world needs a hero

Dave, the White House is calling
They want to talk to me
Tell them that I can't be bought
Tell them that I'm not free

The world needs a heroIt's what you've been waiting for
All the blood, sweat, and tears getting ready
For this one moment, for this one shot

All eyes are focused on you
Everyone is now watching, waiting
It seems the world has stopped turning
The clock's spinning, and you better not blow it

This is the deciding factor
Your personal "come to Jesus" moment
Where they separate winners and losers
Ask yourself; do I really want this bad enough?

I've got to prove myself
I'll turn the night a' light
I'll set this place on fire
I know tonight's the night

There are millions of reasons you should give up
Each one just waiting for you to wash out
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity
Soldier on and drown out the sounds of defeat

The world is yours to take, abandon your "plan B"
Seize everything you've ever wanted
Because for those who think winning comes easy
Luck will be their last dying wish

I've got to prove myself
I'll turn the night a' light
I'll set this place on fire
I know tonight's the nightA legion of uneducated, bankrupt souls
With a lust for revenge, answering the call
From New Yorqatar to Califorabia

Desperation provides fertile ground for religious extremism
This glorious brainwashing where prejudice lies
Like a crouching tiger
Tormenting peasants till they erect an army
Under everyone's nose
In the end propaganda destroys their DNA, god help them

All that they envisioned of what things would come to be
Turned into a pink mist when they blew to smithereens
We are just a war away from Amerikhastan
When God versus god; the undoing of man

Promising a vapor, in the end they become one

No rules of engagement, this enemy hides
Amongst women and children
And to beat violence, you must ignore the focus groups
You must send in the Mossad, turn off the BBC, CNN
and don't look back
Rest assured there'll be no more Middle Eastern crisis, hell!
There'll be no more Middle East!

These are your people Lady Liberty
Pull up your dress today
And tattooed is "Property of the USA
A subsidiary of Halliburton"
Surprise?!
But a roaring lion is about to be unleashed on earth
Hey, Jihad Joe? Guess what? We're coming to get you!

All that you envision of what things will come to be
Turns into a death knell when you look behind the scenes
We are just a war away from Amerkhastan
When God versus god; the undoing of manFull of pride, a heavy load 
You eat yourself, gluttony 
Resent yourself, you envy me 

Everything turns into wrath 
You lust yourself to death 

Deep fears that drive us 
They're hid beneath disguises 
Judge the world within
Or forgive my deadly sins 

Procrastination, always giving up 
Something better comes to interrupt 
Cast your verdict down to me 
Spare me your bleeding sympathy 

Only care how you appear 
Clearly see you can't see clear 

Deep fears that drive us 
Hid beneath disguises 
Judge the world within 
Forgive my deadly sins 

Greed, gluttony, pride, envy, wrath, sloth, lust, deadly seven 
Seven deadly sins of mine 

On every street and corner lie 
These seven deadly sins of mineBattle scars in disarray
A simple man, power drunk
No worries of living, no more anything

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Bastards possesses to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the evil that's within?

Pyramids of dead men and dogs
Spoils of war so they say
Once burned, forever marked
Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Bastards possesses to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the evil that's within?

Pressure coming down
Down on me, gonna break
Broken fingernails
Digging in, scratch your face

Nervous, like a cat
Gonna jump through my skin
Shadows on the wall
Stretching out, grope for me

Evil, evil
Evil, deep in me
Evil, let me be
Evil, let me bleed
Evil, set me free
Evil, set me free
Evil, set me free
The evil that's withinThat locks the door to this hell, the place they wanted me
Time's racing like the wind, execution's near
Oh Lord, I wait for death and, yes, I have no fear

I recall that night, my every breath and step along the way
Closed my eyes, walking as danger paved the way
The devil and the darkness, let her evil wander free
Here on Devil's Island, the final stop for me

Devil's Island
Devil's Island

Oh, there is no escape, the sea is full of sharks
The tide takes you away and smashes you on the rocks
The sun is shining but feel not today
It's warmth, it's dying and fading away

Devil's Island
Here I stay, Devil's Island

Oh, hear the call from the grave beyond
Oh, so pernicious, her soul it creates song
As there is no man, that is here upon the earth
Labeled to terminate our noisome Lucifer

The priest that reads the sermons is walking next to me
To the stake, my last request to have her burn with me
And so it did, the heavens opened, rain began to fall
The final judgment came, and was spread before you all

Final judgment

Old, weak, and feeble and the lessons taught to me
To stay away from evil, she doesn't care for me
She haunts me in my sleep though I tore that page away
And here on Devil's Island, I'll always have to stay

Devil's Island
Devil's Island
Devil's Island
Devil's Island, here I am

Devil's Island, Devil's Island
Devil's Island, Devil's Island
Devil's Island, Devil's Island
Devil's Island, Devil's IslandI'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind
And I'm still awake... Mary Jane

From the earth, up through the trees
I can hear her calling me
Her voice rides on the breeze
Oh, it's haunting me

No, I can't get away
No, there's no escape
If I know I'm going crazy
I must not be insane

Beware my friends, as you pass by
As you are now so once was I
As I am now so you must be
Prepare my friends to follow me

Forgive me father, for I have sinned
I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind
Fingers gripped around my brain
No control, my mind is lame
I'm in the astral plane, and I'll never be the same
Never, never, never, never, never, never
Never, never, never

Beware my friends, as you pass by
As you are now so once was I
As I am now so you must be
Prepare my friends to follow me

It hurts so bad I can't breathe
Prepare to follow meWho do you... who do you think you are?
Some kind of superstar? We'll see!
Where do you... where do you think you are?
That shit won't get you far with me

You're just so dashing, you marvel at the sound
Of your own voice, as you crash into the ground

You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified, the emperor has no clothes

Just so you know, that's how it goes!

You're bad... you're bad for my health
Because you make me sick, you prick
Don't you know... don't you know who I am?
You know I like your face, to kick

If your lips are moving, I know you must be lying
You even suck the life out of dying

You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified, the emperor has no clothes

The house of cards a' falling, luck is running thin
Father forgive him, being a punk is not a sin

You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified, the emperor has no clothes

You look so perfect, perfect, the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, perfect, the emperor has no clothes
And everybody knows... except youThat double life of yours has left your whole world shaking
Who are you fooling?
I know you hear the laughter
Don't you hear people talking?
What is it your after?
Ooh

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's real so you just Disconnect

The key to save yourself if for nothing else
A tongue can never hold the truth of silence is golden
With a broken heart
Underneath all of the pain
Do you stroke the pretty scars?
The hurt never ends, ooh

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's real so you just Disconnect

-Solo-

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's real (that anything's real)
So you just Disconnect

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's real so you just DisconnectAnd headed for the big race
I felt a chill on my backbone
As I hung up the telephone

Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
To lose means trouble, to win pays double
And I got me a heavy bet
Cold, cold sweat

They say chances on the outside
Are looking pretty slim
I feel so lucky on the inside
I feel I'm going to win

Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
Take a little money, there's nothing left to lose
And I got me a heavy bet
Cold, cold sweat

I've got a whole month's wages
I haven't seen that much in ages
I might spend it in stages
And move out to Las Vegas

Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
To lose means trouble, to win pays double
And I got me a heavy bet
Cold, cold sweat

I put my money in a suitcase
They say chances on the outside
I've got a whole month's wages

Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Stone cold crazy, place another betAnd all the reasons I give you to bitch
And how I make you wanna scream in pain
And feel your life is just a losing game

I like the way that you let me in
The way you look when the walls cave in
I like the way that your stomach knots
And how you cry for it all to stop

I like the way that you fool yourself
And make believe there's nobody else
I like the way that you stand in line
And beg salvation from the empty skies
Empty skies

Don't want no revenge
Ain't no pay back time
It ain't called getting even
Here comes the reckoning
Day
Day
Day
Day

I like the things that you try to fake
And your face when I see you break
And that you say you will pray for me
You realize, you are prey for me

I like the way you stay on attack
No matter what, I keep coming back
And how you try to hold me down
But you end up driven to the ground
To the ground

Don't want no revenge
Ain't no pay back time
It ain't called getting even
Here comes the reckoning

Don't want no revenge (don't want no revenge)
Ain't no pay back time (ain't no pay back time)
It ain't called getting even (it ain't called getting even)
Here comes the reckoning
Here comes the reckoning
Day
Day
Day

Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning day

Here comes the reckoning
Here comes the reckoning day
Ooh, here it comes
It's coming to get yaAt mach speed we engage
Feeding people's rage
The big cat's left its cage
Back in the bus again
To catch another plane
This behavior's quite insane
But we do it for the fame, yeah

I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road

The road will never end
It always starts again
Another show's around the bend
Another long lost friend
Faceless as the snow
There's nothing special about the road
It's just another haul
It's just too damn long that's all, yeah

I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road

I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing roadIt won't be long till they replace me
And nothing seems to faze me, anymore

I can't take it, I get the feeling I won't make it
I'm feeling bad and I can't shake it
And now I'm living just to fake it, what's more

Which way is right? Come with me
Which way is wrong? Come with me
Which way is up? Come with me
Which way is down?

Crazy, I'm going crazy, this world's gone crazy
I'm falling off the edge

Lately, I wake each morning feeling beat
And now there's panic in the street
Someone keeps turning up the beat everywhere

Every day, I'm like an actor on the stage
I'll never let you see my rage
I'm not at peace out of my cage anywhere

Which way is right? Come with me
Which way is wrong? Come with me
Which way is up? Come with me
Which way is down?

Crazy, I'm going crazy, this world's gone crazy
I'm falling off the edge
Crazy, We're going crazy, this world's gone crazy
We're falling off the edge

Lately, I can't believe the things I see
This ignorance and apathy
Brings out the lunatic in me, if you care?

It blows my mind, when you sneak off into the night
Maybe it's better that you lie
Just don't forget to say goodbye, if you dare?

Crazy, I'm going crazy, this world's gone crazy
I'm falling off the edge
Crazy, We're going crazy, this world's gone crazy
We're falling off the edgeI am an Antichrist
I am an anarchist
I know what I want and
I know how to get it
I wanna destroy passerby

'Cause I wanna be anarchy
In the city

Anarchy for the U.S.A
It's coming sometime maybe
I give a wrong time stop a traffic line
Your future dream is a shopping scheme

'Cause I wanna be anarchy
In the city,

How many ways
To get what you want?
I use the best, I use the rest
I use the enemy, I use anarchy

'Cause I wanna be anarchy
It's the only way to be

Problem
Problem, have you got a problem?
Problem,

Too many problems, oh why am I here?
I need to be me, 'cause you're all too clear
And I can see there's something wrong with you
Oh, what do you expect me to do?

Bet you thought, you had it all worked out
Bet you thought, you knew what I was about
Bet you thought, you'd solved all your problems
But you are the problem

The problem is you
So, what you gonna do?
It's a problem, I'll leave it to you
Problem, the problem is you
You got a problem
So, what you gonna do?

Is this the MPLA?
Or is this the UDA?
Or is this the IRA
I thought it was the U.S.A
Or just another country
Another council tenancy

'Cause I wanna be anarchy
In the city,

'Cause I wanna be anarchy
'Cause I wanna be anarchy
You know what I mean
'Cause I wanna be anarchy
Anarchist
DestroyIt doesn't matter where you sleep at night, she'll wreck it
It doesn't matter where you go to work
Doesn't matter where you go to church
Doesn't matter just how bad it hurts, she'll wreck it

My bleached bones in the desert, it's all that's left of me

Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much
Home wrecker
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this
Home wrecker

It doesn't matter what you pretend, she'll wreck it
It doesn't matter what you defend, she'll wreck it
It doesn't matter how you live your life
Doesn't matter anymore to your wife
Doesn't matter even how you die, she'll wreck that too

Like a vulture picking my bones clean, it's all that's left of me

Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much
Home wrecker
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this
Home wrecker

It doesn't matter where you live
It doesn't matter what you drive
Home wrecker

Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much
Home wrecker
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this
Home wreckerFull tank, pockets lined with cash
Full throttle, gonna rip some ass
Drive all day, and through the night
Romance the road, winding left and right
The stars above guide me, the moonlight is free
A feeling inside me, and the whole world to see

Driving fast makes me feel good
The speed of light trapped under my hood
Breaking laws, 'cause there's nothing to do
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502

Hundreds of miles rolled off today
Signs lose their meaning, minutes tick away
Dirt roads to interstates, I must have drove them all
Cigarettes and burgers, caffeine and alcohol

Drive until daybreak, always on the go
Life on the freeway, night shift till dawn patrol

Driving fast makes me feel good
The speed of light trapped under my hood
Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502
Stopped for a 502, next time it's gonna be you

Stars above guide me
This feeling inside me
I drive until daybreak
Life on the freeway is hell
I'm coming throughWith confidence I tread through the dead of the night
Off to another wartorn, faraway battlefield
Wherein lies a daemonic enemy horde

On this day I desire to anoint my fists
Engaging them in the mode of power and war
Stopping at nothing that's short of fulfilling my destiny
Willing to die and I will, after you for what I believe

A desperate avenger striking fear in their hearts
Invading their dreams before the day even starts

Whet with your blood, I sharpen my sword
No turning the other cheek like a coward
Come tomorrow, I may lay down and die
But not this day

Sent on an unholy quest, to reduce all those who resist
To the size of their shriveled up souls and scatter them like grist
I vanquished the strangleholds that the netherworld sets for me
The last request of my life is to die killing my enemies

Bathed in blood up to the horse's bridle
It's death to retreat, there's no chance of survival

Whet with your blood, I sharpen my sword
No turning the other cheek like a coward
Come tomorrow I may lay down and die
But not this day, this day we fight!

This day we fight!

Strip the fallen heroes, finish off the wounded
Collect the spoils of war and send them back dead

This day we fight!
This day I fight!Flowing constantly
My broken body is a wreck
Wrapped around a tree
A crosswalk hit and run
The finish line for me
People clutter in the gutter
Take a look and see

No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging onto life
By the skin o' my teeth

My blood flows through the streets
Deluge from the wounds
Empty jars of sleeping pills
On the dresser in my room
My wet brain neighbor cranes
His neck to see in time
The white lights a train
Bearing down on me

No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o' my teeth

I won't feel the hurt
I'm not trash any longer
That that doesn't kill me
Only makes me stronger
I need a ride to the morgue
Thats what 911 is for
So, tag my toe and don't forget
Ooh, to close the drawer

No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o' my teethMany centuries ago
Came the spawning of Christ
And the Antichrist
And darkness fell upon our people
And the children, they
were born faceless
Without eyes they could not see
Born unto themselves
They lived and they died
In the Millennium of the BlindIn perpetual writhing 
The primordial ooze 
And the sanity they lose 

Awakened in the morning 
To more air pollution warnings 
Still we sleepwalk off to work 
While our nervous systems jerk 

Pretending not to notice 
How history had forebode us 
With the greenhouse in effect 
Our environment was wrecked 

Now I can only laugh 
As I read our epitaph 
We end our lives as moles 
In the dark of dawn patrolAnd my prayers are never answered
But you'll never see the pain inside of me
Stabbing me over and over and over
I trusted you and I loved you
And you spit back in my face
How could you do this to me?
When will you stop trying to hurt me?
I've walked a minefield for you
A career in hell with you
I have made it through the things
Others would surely die just watching
And the oath I take on this day
Is to know that you will be repaid
One day the the sun will die and the night will crawl
Until then, until I see your world implode
I wish you death and suffering
Misery to spare
Time to rehearse your pain
Face the last enemy
I am the last thing you will know
The last thing you will see
I see your death surrounding me
I know you, yes I do
I know you

When no words are spoken and pleas are ignored
Your tears go unnoticed, will you say enough?
When prayers are unanswered and your calls are unheard
The pain cuts right through you, have you seen enough?

It all seems so deceitful and the verdict is lies
A black cloud of indecision compromised your life

When judgement has failed you
When your own heart's impaled you
Your wandering mind has destroyed you
Will you ever know when?

When you give everything and the feeling is gone
All the giving is fake, did you fake enough?
When you take everything and you stay too long
When there's nothing left, did you take enough?Another gunman will come seeking my defeat 
Will he be as fast as me, are his nerves quiet and still 
Will he fall like all the rest 
Ending his days upon boothill 

I'm an outcast riding into town alone 
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone 
I'm an outcast riding into town alone 
I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone 

As I ride into the sunset to take another town 
Thank you for the invite, but I just can't settle down 
The dust that coats my hat is from a dozen towns 
Dust from shooting down another dozen clowns 

I'm an outcast riding into town alone 
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone 
I'm an outcast riding into town alone 
I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone 

A drum beats for me, it's louder every day 
The cadence tells me that soon I'll meet my judgement day

My judgement day...

A drum beats for me, it gets louder every day
The cadence tells me that soon I'll meet my judgement day 

Life's an endless showdown 
Never knowing when they'll come 
I sleep with one eye open lying with my smoking gun 

The game I play has caused a lot of grief 
They were dying for fame, so I obliged them some relief 
They were dying for fame, I obliged them some relief

I'm an outcast riding into town alone 
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone 
I'm an outcast with lightning in my hand 
I got wanderlust lost in no man's land 
I got a lust for wandering lost in no man's land 
I got wanderlustTo swallow alive some harmless souls
Walking a crooked path, their wicked names will rot

Evil lives in the dark, its right is doing wrong
The torment never ends . . . it never ends

The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane

Trapped in this "no man's land"
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned to the realms
Of the Never Dead

There's no one trust from this grave
Die with those they swear to defend
Feeding on the ones they'll feed off in the end

Evil lives in the dark, its right is doing wrong
The torment never ends . . . it never ends

The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane

Trapped in this "no man's land"
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned to the realms
Of the Never Dead

Death sits before you, to press on is suicide
Life spills out of your body, you wither and die
For the rest of your life in the realms of the Never Dead

The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane

Trapped in this "no man's land"
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned to the realms
Of the Never DeadI hope the end is less painful than my life
I stand on trial before the gods on Judgment Day
A blink of an eye between the cradle and the grave

One last look at visions of flesh 
The last best hope of man on earth 
Pontius Pilate still washing his hands 
The world don't want to be saved, only left alone

 We are storming the heavens
 To raise the swords and shields
 We ascend to our destiny
 To the Elysian Fields

Soaring to the sun with blood upon their wings
Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind
Man still has one belief, one decree that stands alone
The laying down of arms is like cancer to their bones

One last look at visions of flesh 
The last best hope of man on earth 
Pontius Pilate still washing his hands 
The world don't want to be saved, only left alone

 We are storming the heavens
 To raise the swords and shields
 We ascend to our destiny
 To the Elysian Fields

 We are storming the heavens
 To raise the swords and shields
 We ascend to our destiny
 To the Elysian Fields
  We are storming the heavens
  To raise the swords and shields
  We ascend to our destiny
 To the Elysian FieldsHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures 
He leadeth me beside the still waters 
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me 
In the paths of righteousness for his name's sake 
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me 
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies 
Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over 
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life 
And I will dwell in the house of the LORD for everFeel at home in our black conventicle
As we anathematize all of those who oppose us

Don't summon the devil
Don't call the priests
If you need the strength
The conjuring, obey

Behold the flames rise from the compasses' cardinal points
Burn the sacred oil and, with the ashes, you'll anoint

Arrange the symbols of the wizard and magician
Light the candles, place the parchment paper in position
Between its leaves, place the lash from a black cat's eye
A straw of a broom, fold and burn and centralize

Don't summon the devil
And don't call the priests
If you need the strength
The conjuring

I am the devil's advocate, a salesman if you will
You know my name
You know my name

I met your father years ago, gave him what he'd please
He called my name
You'll do the same

I'm claiming what is mine by right, it's time to close the deal
You're bought and sold
Bought and sold

Come join me in my infernal depths, Mephisto's hall of fame
I've got your soul
I've got your soul

The conjuring
ObeyI'm winding down, I'm growing tired
Seconds drift into the night
The clock just ticks till my time expires

You were once my friend
Now I know I can't tie your hands
The days I saved I couldn't spend
They fell like sand through the hourglass
No time to lose, no time to choose

Time taking time, it's taken mine
Scenes of my life seem so unkind
Time chasing time, creeps up behind
I can't run forever, and time waits for no one
Not even me

I heard somebody fixed today
There was no last goodbyes to say
His will to live ran out
I heard somebody turned to dust
Looking back at what he left
A list of plans and photographs
Songs that never will be sung
These are the thinge he won't get done

I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use that man

Just one shot to say goodbye
One last taste to mourn and cry
Scores and shoots, the lights go dim
Just one shot to do him in

He hangs his head and wonders why
Why the monkey only lies
But pay the pauper, he did choose
He hung his head inside the noose

I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use that man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the coffin on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle in his hand
Cryptic writing on the wall, the beginning of the end
I've seen myself use the needle, seen the needle in my handOne day you're here and then you're gone
This is the moment I've lived my whole life for
And I'll never give up; I've waited too long

I've waited, waited too long
I've waited too long

And all along the road, all the bodies left behind
May all have been good friends; just not good friends of mine

I've been kicked out and said I quit
Then I said, "I had enough" and "This is it"
All I wanted was just one more show for the road
'Cause it was over last time before I could blink, I could blink

I've waited, waited too long
I've waited too long

And all along the road, all the bodies left behind
May all have been good friends; just not good friends of mine

Their bodies left behindKilling for religion, something I don't understand
Fools like me, who cross the sea and come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep, for their beliefs, do you kill on God's command?

A country that's divided, surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace, no foolish naive stand
The end is near, it's crystal clear, part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel, it might be your homelands
Holy wars

Upon my podium, as the know-it-all scholar
Down in my seat of judgment, gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holier-than-thou could-be messenger of God

Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, repel down the rocks, behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me
Some people live to destroy me
Either way they die
They die

They killed my wife and my baby with hopes to enslave me
First mistake, last mistake
Paid by the alliance to slay all the giants
Next mistake, no more mistakes

Fill the cracks in with judicial granite
Because I don't say it don't mean I ain't thinkin' it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings, mercy killings
Mercy killings, killings, killings, killings
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts awayin a rhetoric of equals
No such things as hell, not heaven, continues,
The code of annihilation confronts with social attack
As the flames of death are filled with brains in flux intact
No one would ever die too soon
Before the beginning of the baby boom
And before the beginning of an era in gubernatorial rhetoric
The rules of death and brutal attack while most men rise from the sick
The mortal path of greed and demonic inaction 
Is about to be destroyed by demons attacking each other's adoration

This is the code of annihilation
Putting an end to devastation and distraction

(Repeat chorus)

And now, let demonic combat reign intact
Before male human mercenaries are ready to attack evil fallout
But it is not every male human being's fault

This is the code of annihilation
Putting an end to devastation and distraction

(Repeat chorus)

And now, let demonic combat reing intact
Before male human mercenaries are ready to attack evil fallout
But it is not every male human being's fault

This is the code of annihilation
Putting an end to devastation and distractionBut rest assured, they're out there and they're coming
If you listen, the sound is growing nearer of infantry
Marching out a hypnotizing rhythm

Destroying every town, light it up and burn it down
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends

Above the ring of clashing steel, they raise flags of war
A sign to all the warriors who cannot hear
Amidst smoke of cannonballs, they bang the drums of death
Pound a cadence out for those who cannot see

Destroying every town, light it up and burn it down
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends
Poison the wells and scorch the earth, everything's slashed and burnt
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends

Destroying every town, light it up and burn it down
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends
Poison the wells and scorch the earth, everything's slashed and burnt
You may not like it now, but this is how the story endsEmbers of avarice soon begin to soar
Vengeance breeding greater vengeance, two eyes for one eye
Crowning burning hatred that’s lying deep inside

A token gift, destroyers deep within its hold
Revenge of patient men is sweet and best served cold
The enemy inside the belly of the beast
A mighty Trojan horse, tonight the sentries sleep

On the march... No place to run
Time has come... No where to hide
The moon is red... No one is safe
From spilling blood... no living thing survives

Here they fight... regretting nothing
Here you die... the walls are caving in
Nothing left... a lethal encounter
Its judgment time... when death comes from within

Warning signs ignored, they have all but been denied
Prophets and messengers, mocked and vilified
Final destination lying deep inside their court
Their first line of defense soon became their last resort

Hardened deceivers entered through their open gates
Silent trained assassins, lying still, in wait

You look so perfect, but everybody knows
Their petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
Their just so petrified, the emperor has no clothes

Death from within...Wizard, all knowing, all wise

I want to rule this kingdom
Make sweet the breeze, now defiled

Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists
In velvet gloves of sin

Parade the grey robed monks
Those vestal virgins, wheel the wyverns in

Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage
Let me be the protege of five magics

Give me alchemy, give me wizardry
Give me sorcery, thermatology
Electricity, magic if you please
Master all of these, bring him to his knees

I master five magics
I master five magics
I master five magics
I master five magics

Possessed with hellish torment (Possessed with hellish torment)
I master magics five (I master magics five)
Hunting the abyss lord (Hunting the abyss lord)
Only one will stay alive (Only one will stay alive)

He who lives by the sword (He who lives by the sword)
Will surely also die (Will surely also die)
He who lives in sin (He who lives in sin)
Will surely live the lieMultiple personalities
Terror inside of me
A mask of silent agony

Curse the falling rain
The vortex of pain

As medieval as Merlin
A pact for power was made
Lucifer in transition
It's time, time the price was paid

Scorching the domain
The vortex of pain

A telestic message
Written in torment
Howl out dirges
Like the horns of Jericho
Distorted faces writhing in rage
Walls of purgatory tumble down
Endless death
The jewels of a crown
The jewels of a crownThe tigers eat their young...
The body stayed but inside the head,
The mind was on the run.
A conspiracy of silence.
The only way out of pain,
Is turn around, run through it man !
Too wet to come in from the rain...
Tell them...

I know they were doing it to you...
But don't try doing it to me !

Let me show you, how I love you,
It's our secret, you and me
Let me show you, how I love you,
But keep it in the family...

When you hear them saying "trust me",
Don't wait to see what's next...
Thrown to the wolves forever trusting
Raised in a form of living hell.
Sing a one note song of rage
Live and die within your heart
So beware in the shadows,
Your family tree waits in the dark
I say...

I know they were doing it to you...
But don't try doing it to me ! No! No!...

Let me show you, how I love you,
It's our secret, you and me.
Let me show you, how I love you,
But keep it in the family tree.
Let me show you, how I love you,
It's our secret, you and me.
Let me show you, how I love you,
The secret ... of the family tree...Better left for dead
And now we are on a mission
Well, it's full speed ahead
My legions, when we do the crime
Let's get one thing straight
To get there early is on time
And showing up on time is late

Ladies and gents
We're still alive
By the skin of our teeth
Now it's killing time
Angel in our pocket
Devil by our side
We ain't going nowhere, 'cause heroes never die

 Blood of heroes
 They never die
 Blood of heroes
 They never die

We've been run down every hill
Chased up all the dead end streets
But if you try to cut us out
You'll get a kick in the teeth

Ladies and gents
We're still alive
By the skin of our teeth
Now it's killing time
Fasten up your head belts
It's time to ride the skies
It's time to be immortal, 'cause heroes never die

 Blood of heroes
 They never die
 Blood of heroes
 They never die

Blood of heroes
Blood of heroes
Blood of heroes
They never die
 Blood of heroes
 Blood of heroes
 Blood of heroes
 Blood of heroes
