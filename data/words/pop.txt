And you fit like a glove
That is no way to live
That is no way to love
Full of fear in your skin
And the weakness in giving in

You're stabbed in the back
But you feel no pain
Push the heaviest doors
That you can't open
Yeah, they tied me up
And my body lies still again

You're as bright as the sun
And as calm as the moon
I don't know when you'll break
But it's gonna be soon
If my will caves in
I'll be in the same boat as you

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand
"The meaning of"

Hands on strings
And my mouth open
Find the perfect words
That I've not spoken
And I won't tell the truth
Unless you want me to

For all of the times
That I lost my head
When it rolled to the floor
And I found it again
But when it came back
No, I didn't know my own name

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand
"The meaning of"

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand
"The meaning of"

The meaningI'm just a victim of the weapon in my hand
So many casualties of love
But I've been bulletproof
I'm staring at the sun!

I was the one you took home
Never a flame to burn slow
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
So many bodies I've touched
Crashing around me like dust
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

I don't need nobody
Need nobody but
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you

I'm just so used to emptiness
Can't feel your heartbeat when I'm lying on your chest
You're different from the ones before
I know you don't believe it's you I've waited for

I was the one you took home
Never a flame to burn slow
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
So many bodies I've touched
Crashing around me like dust
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

I don't need nobody
Need nobody but
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you

But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

I don't need nobody
Need nobody but
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but youAnyway far from here
Wanting home tonight
Feeling the cold fear

I don't speak as you do
I don't even know who I am (Who am I?)
My hands are getting colder
Your temper's gettin' older

Where are you going to?
Are you trying to take off it?
My heart is always searching
But you're not climbing

Carry up to me (Escalante)
Hold the air I breathe (Escalante)
What you say you said? (Escalante)
A steep mountain
And your stones were stained with my poison
Escalante

The whole shit is coming back from me
A fingerprint decayed with hate
If you love me, you should show me
How to reconsider what I did

Take me again, again and again
To the place where there's no dark
I can't steal your sight again
But I can kill you in the dark

Carry up to me (Escalante)
Hold the air I breathe (Escalante)
What you say you said? (Escalante)
A steep mountain
And your stones were stained with my poison
Escalante

Carry up to me (Escalante)
Hold the air I breathe (Escalante)
What you say you said? (Escalante)
A steep mountain
And your stones were stained with my poison
Again and again
Carry up to me (know you know it)
Hold me, hold me (I'm feeling empty)
What do we have done (breaking the relief)
A steep mountain, and you know I love it
EscalanteAnd the cherry sky
Under blossom clouds
Though it's late July
You don't even try
Still you look so cool
Like a cover boy when you light the moon

Need the countryside
But I just forgot
All the things that matter
I forget a lot
I get so caught up
In the city crowd
But this place is still my first love

Is there anybody out there
Waiting for me on my way
If that somebody is you
Then baby I just want to say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

Guess I need to run
Take me to the bus
But don't let me go
No, don't let me on
Got to hold me tight
Won't put up a fight
Of course I'll stay
I'll stay the night

Is there anybody out there
Waiting for me on my way
If that somebody is you
Then baby I just want to say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

We're at the lost and found
We're at the lost and found

Is there anybody out there
Waiting for me on my way
If that somebody is you
Then baby I just want to say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

We're at the lost and found
We're at the lost and foundShouldn't need a riddle to unlock your heart
So, say what's on your mind
We got other things that we could do with our
Time, we could rule the world
Know you say you never need another girl
But, you're not making sense
Trying to keep it moving while you're on the fence

Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes

It's a mystery
I know that something happened in your history
Oh, it's too much to risk
You give me some, but you've been holding most of it
Back, so it's no surprise
Everything you do, I over analyze
Breathe, in and out
Baby, give me something new to think about

Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes

Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codesWe've only ever touched
When there's no one else around
I can be elusive if you want me to
I'm not being intrusive
I just wish I knew the truth

As to why 
I wait for you
Longer than the average person would
And why
I think about you 
More than I think one should

Our body's fit together like a makeshift puzzle
And It's clear to see why you puzzle me
when you turn your frame
And you whisper my name
As though I am a burden

And I know
and I know
this will happen again and again
so don't let us pretend that this is the end
this is the end
this is the end

I am at your house
So I belong to you for now
Trying to impress you 
But lord I don't know how
I can be a statue if you want me to
I'm not being difficult I just need to know the truth

As to why
I'm wanting you
And I would take you away if I could
And why I'm still here
It's something I still haven't understood

Our hands press together like pieces of paper
But they're always blank when I hold your hand
And it gave you a fright
When I stayed the night
Cus you gave yourself to me

And I'm making up for last time
And I'm making up for you
And I'm waking up from last night
And I'm waking up with you
So what's new
So what's new
So what's new

Our hands press together like pieces of paper
But they're always blank when I hold your hand
And it gave you a fright
When I stayed the night
Cus you gave yourself to me

And I'm making up for last time
And I'm making up for you
And I'm waking up from last night
And I'm waking up with you
So what's new
So what's new
So what's new
So what's newEvery day it seems your life is up and down
And you say that you're looking for an answer
Everywhere you look it seems it can't be found

Like searching, trying to find the rainbow
No one's ever found it, yet it's told to be
But if you're looking for a lover
Everything you need, yeah, you can find right here with me

I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul

Now you've been trapped by love
Someone takes your heart and then says goodbye
So you say that you'll never love another
Tired of playing games and that's the reason why

But now whenever were together
There's a certain feeling that we both agree
And it's time that you've opened up to love
'Cause if you don't ever try, then baby, you may never see

I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul

Together you and I were meant to be
I'll be right beside you whenever you need me
This love you have will never fade away
You can count on me 'cause I'm here to stay

I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soulRunning through the woods, running through this shots
Tryna to survive a day!
All I want is that you extend your hand to me
Singing outside waiting for the words to come
Living my life tryna do what's right,
And hope for a better day
You know those words you wrote me brought me to my knees
All I'm saying is that

You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, to be alone
You're home, hope you find your way home

Singing outside waiting for the world to call
Living my life tryna do what's right
In the hope of a better day
And all I want is that you extend your hand to me
Oooh, I want show me where it hurts,
We'll make it OK
Tell me that you'll stay
Even when I'm far away
My voice will carry through
Until the end it's me & you
We can make it if we try
All that I'm saying is that

You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, to be alone
You're home, hope you find your way home

You're never gonna be aloneFeeling this way for you
There's something in the way you move
Something in the way you move
With you I'm never healing
It's heartache through and through
There's something in the way you move
Don't know what it is you do

Not one bone in your body good enough for me
But this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve
When our eyes meet I can only see the end
But tonight I'm here yours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what're you waiting for?

Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh

There's an evil night air
The stars don't shine tonight
Something in the way you do
Something in the way you

Push me closer, further
Break me just enough
Your lies always seem so true
There's nothing left for me to lose

There's not one thing I can do to change your ways
But I can't sit back and take the lonely days
When our eyes meet I can only see the end
And tonight the rain pours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what're you waiting for?

Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what're you waiting for?

Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
OhBut you know what you are here for
Close your eyes
Lay yourself beside me
Hold tide for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone we don't need attention

Open your hand 
Take a glass
Don't be scared 
I'm right here
Even though you don't roll
Trust me boy 
You wanna be high for this

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Take it off
You want it off
Cause I know what you're feeling
It's ok
Boy I feel it too
Let it be 
Baby, breathe
I swear I'm right here
We'll be good
I promise we'll be so good

Oh, open your hand 
Take a glass
Don't be scared 
I'm right here
Even though you don't roll
Trust me boy 
You wanna be high for this

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-ohIn the back of a car with you, I stare into the sun
Still not too old to die young
But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
Way, way, way, way
(And then you take it all away)
Way, way, way, way

Place a kiss on my cheekbone
Then you vanish me, I'm buried in the snow
But something tells me I'm not alone

But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
Way, way, way, way
(And then you take it all away)
Way, way, way, way

So lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything
So lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away

I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
Way, way, way, way
(And then you take it all away)
Way, way, way, wayI think I know what you're trying to say
Honey, it's fair play
Why try to win when I know I've lost?
We don't have to spell it
I think I know what you're trying to say
Just because I think this could break me
It doesn't mean that it will at all

Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you, babe
Do what you have to

What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me

Let's call it a day, babe
I think I know what you're trying to say
And honey you're so right
There's so much to lose, but so much to learn
Let's call it a maybe
But we both know you're already gone
And just because it feels like I'm breaking
It doesn't mean I will fall apart

Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you, babe
Do what you have to

What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me

Love to you, babe

It's good for meChosen specially for you and I
Who will live inside

The mountaineers gathered tinder piled high 
In which to take along
Driving many miles, knowing they'd get here 

When they got here, all exhausted 
On the roof leaks they got started 
And now when the rain comes, we can be thankful 

Ooh, ah, ooh
When the mountaineers saw that everything fit
They were glad, and so they took off

Thought we were due
For a change or two
Around this place

When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay with 

The village used to be all one really needs 
Now it's filled with hundreds and hundreds of chemicals
That mostly surround you 
You wish to flee, but it's not like you 
So listen to me, listen to me 

Oh, oh, and when the morning comes
We will step outside 
We will not find another man in sight
We like the newness, the newness of all 
That has grown in our garden soaking for so long 

Whenever I was a child
I wondered what if my name had changed
Into something more productive like Roscoe 
Been born in 1891 
Waiting with my Aunt Rosaline 

Thought we were due
For a change or two 
Around this place

When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay with 

Oh

1891
They roamed around and foraged
They made their house from cedars
They made their house from stone

Oh, they're a little like you
And they're a little like me
We have all we need

Thought we were due
For a change or two 
Around this place 
This place, this place

When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay with
When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay withMakes my heartbeat like a drum
See the panic in my eyes
Kiss me, hold me when I cry
'Cause you always want what you're running from
And you know this is more than you can take

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh, your touch so bittersweet
Aahhh, ah aaha
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us

Your cheek is softly by the sun
Makes my heartbeat like a drum
I know it hurts you
I know it burns you
Hot and cold in a lonely hotel room
Look into me, tell me why you're crying
I need to know

'Cause you always want what you're running from
And it's always been that way
Oh

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh, your touch so bittersweet
Aahhh, ah aaha
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us

'Cause you always want what you're running from

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh, your touch so bittersweet
Aahhh, ah aaha
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks usAnd I gave in
I lacked the things you need the most, you said
Where have you been?

You wasted all that sweetness to run and hide
I wonder why
I remind you of the days you poured your heart into
But you never tried

I've fallen from grace
Took a blow to my face
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost

Explosions
On the day you wake up needing somebody
And you've learned it's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same
It will never be the same

You left my soul bleeding in the dark
So you could be king, ah
The words you said are still untold to me
And I've lost my faith in everything

The nights you could cope, your intentions were gold
But the mountains will shake
I need to know I can still make...

Explosions
On the day you wake up needing somebody
And you've learned it's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same

And as the floods move in
And your body starts to sink
I was the last thing on your mind
I know you better than you think
'Cause it's simple, darling
I gave you a warning
Now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces
So watch them fall with you in slow-motion
I pray that you'll find peace of mind
And I'll find you another time

I'll love you another time

Explosions
On the day you wake up needing somebody
And you've learned it's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the sameLet it all fall out, open your mouth
Often I lie wide awake, think of things I can make
But I don't seem to have the parts to build them

Human, I wonder why you're a better make
Than I could ever build or create, you know not love or hate
I am so scared of what will kill me in the end
For I am not prepared, I hope I will get the chance

To be someone, to be human 
Look what we've done, look what we've done

I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)

Human, I'm trying to come clean, I will be a better me
I will not drink until I'm dead, I'll make the most of it
I don't know what it's like to be alive, to say goodbye
To cry a thousand times because my ears won't listen

Human, I'm trying not to lose my faith in you
I've sussed out all that I've seen through, I've sailed an ocean
I am so scared of what I'll look like in the end
For I am not prepared, I hope I will get the chance

To be someone, to be human
Look what we've done, look what we've done

I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)

I used to hear it all so loud, the sound of my heart breaking
The truth is waiting to be found, I trust that I will take it 

I would give my life
I would give my life (Human)
I would give my life (Human)
I would give my life (Human)

I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)Makes my body ache and I'm ready
To fall into the sky
I see now
The reason why

Yeah
Yeah

This feeling is heavy
Makes my body ache and I'm ready
To fall into the sky
I see now
The reason why
My heart is heavy
Takes me to a place I can't breathe
Only then I know why I see
The warning sign

This feeling is heavy
Makes my body ache and I'm ready
To fall into the sky
I see now
The reason why

This feeling is heavy
Makes my body ache and I'm ready
To fall into the sky
I see now
The reason why
My heart is heavy
Takes me to a place I can't breathe
Only then I know why I see
The warning signSooner or later I'll be on my own
June into summer, I'll wear out my shoes
Tune into someone, got nothing to lose

Without your love I'm getting somewhere

Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere

Move in the sun till I burn all my ties
Hay fever scratching and watery eyes
I think I've been waiting for this all my life
Coldest dark kisses left frozen in timeHit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning

Handle bars, and then I let go, let go for anyone
Take me in, and throw out my heart and get a new one
Next thing, we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes

So we burst into colors, colors and carousels
Fall head first, like paper planes and playground games
Next thing, we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes

Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching

Hit me with lightning

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goesKnow your bullets fly through the night
Broken doors falling, and hotel floors 
I was never yours, never mine

All I said was "Hello, hello"
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time
And all I said was "Hello, hello"
Tell me how to say "goodbye", cause it's goodbye

I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it die

See change whispers in the waves
Watch my sorrows drown peacefully
And empires crumble to the shores
I was never yours, never mine

All I said was "Hello, hello"
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time
And all I said was "Hello, hello"
Tell me how to say "goodbye", cause it's goodbye

I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it die

I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it die
I can't stay on my knees (on my knees)
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die (it's alright)
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it dieWith a spinning head I lie and watch you smoke
Change the hands on my watch and hold you close
This misery is weightless as a stone

Have you lost the same things I have lost?
Do you know the panic I know?
And would I see the terror in your face?
Do you know that fever I know?
I wish time was still we'd stay right here
With time to kill in our hearts without chains
And if time was still we'd have no fear
Or scars to heal in our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chains

You left everything behind except yourself
And all I see is question marks and nothing else
You must've landed in New York by now
Please don't bring this love down

Have you lost the same things I have lost?
Do you know the panic I know?
And would I see the terror in your face?
Do you know that fever I know?
I wish time was still we'd stay right here
With time to kill in our hearts without chains
And if time was still we'd have no fear
Or scars to heal in our hearts without chains
In a house without chains

Don't bring this love down
Don't bring this love down
Don't bring this love down
Don't bring this love down

I wish time was still we'd stay right here
With time to kill in our hearts without chains
And if time was still we'd have no fear
Or scars to heal in our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chainsPart of you, bittersweet
But now you tell me lies
Up and down, cold and hot
Swear to God, got to stop
Because I can't sleep at night
If you wanted love like this
Blowing up with every kiss
Should've known better

Because you find yourself alone
Chilling you right to the bone
No, should've known better

You and me just
Running towards the light
Giving up the fight
Hoping we survive

You and me just
Strangers in the night
Giving up the fight
Waiting to ignite

Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life

Lost in you, lost in me
Afraid of love, in too deep
So we just run and hide

Lightening fast, felt the crash
Scared to lose, fear attacks
We only know goodbye

You and me just
Running towards the light
Giving up the fight
Hoping we survive

You and me just
Strangers in the night
Giving up the fight
Waiting to ignite

Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life

If you wanted love like this
Blowing up with every kiss
Should've known better

Then you find yourself alone
Chilling you right to the bone
No, should've known better

Hopelessly holding on
To all those perfect nights
Let's pretend it's not gone
And say we'll never die

You and me just
Running towards the light
Giving up the fight
Hoping we survive

You and me just
Strangers in the night
Giving up the fight
Waiting to ignite

Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life

Hopelessly holding on
To all those perfect nights
Let's pretend it's not gone
And say we'll never die
Say we'll never dieCover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over

Yes, since we found out
Since we found out

That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

After the war we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its colour

But now I've seen it through
And now I know the truth

Baby, I'll give you everything you need
I'll give you everything you need, oh
I'll give you everything you need
But I don't think I need you

Stripped to the waist
We fall into the river
Cover your eyes
So you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath
To see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year
I knew the panic was over

Yet since we found out
Since we found out
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
Oh, whoa

But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need youDo I get the best of your love
Even when our bodies are drunk
Is it me you're stumbling from
Forget the words that you said
With your fingers spell out my name
Take away the sky in our breath
Remember love is a game, love is a game

Don't break, don't fade
While we're not real, we're never too late
Make time, it won't hurt
Said I'll go now, but you said it first

I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste

In the midst I'm seeing your face
And I can't believe this is fake
Blow the blossom into your room
As you throw me in disarray
There's a button that I need to press
There's a face that I need to kiss
Come on, give me your heart and your head
Make you conscious never resist, never resist

Don't break, don't fade
While we're not real, we're never too late
Make time, it won't hurt
Said I'll go now, but you said it first

I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste

I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertasteWe hold our heads up high tonight
And we breathe the smoke ethereal
We let our hearts subside tonight

But it marks the skin 'cause I know I've sinned
And it plagues the air on my house movin'
There's a sound out here in the darkest woods
And I know my own fears are understood

It's a ritual and I know you feel it
It's a ritual and I know you've seen it
It's a ritual and I know you feel it
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it

We jump into the devil's shoes
It's far too late to be rescued
From high we see some thundered skies
We see our faith, you hear our cries, it comes

And it won't stop here, echo in my ear
There's a raging fire and it burns so near
But I'm ready now, but I'm ready now

The ritual, we lose it allRunning from the truth because the truth's too much to take
I keep raising glasses because I only got today
I just keep moving, I just keep moving

You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
Happy, in rain or thunder
Baby I keep
I keep on, I keep on, I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing

Can you see my, see my headlights
You can come ride shotgun with me
Whatever you like, ever you like
Every time I look at those stars
Know they ain't got the answers for me
But I'll be alright, I'll be alright

You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
Happy, in rain or thunder
Baby I keep
I keep on, I keep on, I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing

I just keep on dancing
(Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing)

You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
I just keep on dancing
(Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing)
I just keep on dancing
(Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing)
I just keep on dancingAnd you were someone else
I'd say so much to you
And I would tell the truth

'Cause I can hardly breathe
When your hands let go of me
The ice is thinning out
And my feat brace themselves

I'm there in the water
Still looking for ya
I'm there in the water
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

You've seen this all before
Life left on the shore
We're smiling all the same
You sail away again

Oh, yeah
I'm dead in the water (I'm dead in the water)
Still looking for ya (Still looking for ya)
I'm dead in the water (I'm dead in the water)
Can't you see? (Can't you see?)
Can't you see?I would’ve listened to my brother when he spoke to me
And I never would’ve played with my conscience
In the fields where I was in their company

But you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I used them on my youth
And you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, and I won’t lose them

Now I found my feet
Count to one, two, three
And I’m taking off tonight, now I’m free
As I walk my feet on the cold concrete
And I, and I, and I

I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city, eh eh eh

I wandered down the streets with my new town
With the lights blinding and my heart weighed down
I think I'll get a job receiving people's thunder
For the folks back home, I will make them proud

But you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I used them on my youth
Yeah, you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I don't wanna lose them
I don't wanna lose them

I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city, eh eh eh

Shoulders ache for want of wings
My city shakes the fear in me

I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city, eh eh ehTake another sip
(Don't panic)
Stop checking your phone
Looking for the answers
(Don't panic)
Mind running obsessed
Feeling paralyzed
(Don't panic)
Let me watch you undress
Fall into the night

Yeah we change and we change and we feel so lost
And we don't know who we are
Yeah we break and we break and we just can't stop,
So we just keep breaking hearts

Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can we take it back to the start?
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic

Been shattered before
Everything breaks
(Don't)
I can't really be sure
Of our mistakes
(Don't panic)
Come under my love
Like an umbrella
(Don't panic)
Going to make you feel good
Yeah, better than ever

Yeah we change and we change and we feel so lost
And we don't know who we are
Yeah we break and we break and we just can't stop
So we just keep breaking hearts

Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can we take it back to the start
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic

I got big dreams, baby
I got big dreams, baby
So don't you overcomplicate it
I got big dreams, baby
I got big dreams, baby
So don't you, don't you overcomplicate it

Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can we take it back to the start
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic
Don't panic
Don't panicWho are we to play with hearts and throw away it all?
Who are we to turn each others heads?
Who are we to find ourselves in other people’s beds?

I don't like the way I never listen to myself
I feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help
Oh, I don't think you want me much at all

This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
I'm feeling down about this love

Who are you to make me feel so good?
Who are we to tell ourselves that we're misunderstood?
Who am I to say I'm always yours?
Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores?

I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart
Now we're falling on each other like we're always in the dark
Oh, I don't think you know me much at all, all, all, at all

This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall

This love is not what you want
This heart will never be yours
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfallI do what I love and I love what I do

How many times do I need to
Need to fight you baby
Just to get that it's no good

And I know that I'm strong
But my mind's almost gone
And it's getting on my mood
And all this buzzing you been doing
See you got me hanging up
See you really got me worse

But I got to move on baby
Because bitches got to eat
Got to get back to work

Something's calling us
We're breaking free
I'm curious I need to see
Like a flash before our eyes we'll leap toward the night
And if it feels like we're dreaming
Believe it, believe it (Yeah)

We don't have to wait till the morning
The sun will never go down (Yeah)
What we'll do it wait forever
We gotta take it now (Yeah)
So stay awake, stay awake
You can stay with us till paradise
So stay awake, stay awake

Hand in hand side by side
While our reflections flicker bodies collide
So full of energy nothing to hide
No need to sleep we come alive
And if we're gonna take this ride we can go wherever we like
And if it feels like we're dreaming
Believe it, believe it (Yeah)

We don't have to wait till the morning
The sun will never go down (Yeah)
What we'll do it wait forever

So stay awake, stay awake
You can stay with us till paradise
So stay awake, stay awakeI'll take you to the ocean, I'll bring the sun
We are 17, we have just begun
I have loved to fight for and then some
You are the one, the one, the one, the one
The one, the one, the one, the one

Wake up in the morning, we're paralyzed
We'll fly into the garden like butterflies
There will be no blood and there'll be no pain
I want to fall in love with you again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal, an animal, an animal

I'll tie you in my arms, I will smother you
We'll tell each other lies, I will tell the truth
I'll colour in the sky, and I'll colour you
I want to join your skin again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal, an animal

We will run away from danger
We will run away
I-I-I-I-I, I will have to fight for...

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal, an animalLike a last breath you would breathe
You were like home to me
I don't recognize this street

Please don't close your eyes
Don't know where to look without them
Outside the cars speed by
I've never heard them until now

I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it
You were just saving yourself when you hide it

Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin
And I know you care

I used to run down the stairs
To the door and I thought you were there
To shape to the comfort of us
Two lovers locked out of love

Oh, but I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it
You were just saving yourself when you hide it

Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin

I know it wasn't always wrong
But I've never known a winter so cold
Now I don't warm my hands in your coat
But I still hope
'Cause this is how things ought to have been

And I know the worst of it
Wasn't all that it seemed
Why can't I dream, why can't I dream?
'Cause I know you care

And I know you care
I know you care, I know you care
I know it's always been thereMm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

Only you can be
The aching in my heart, my enemy
The only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive

Only you

Only you can see 
The emptiness I feel when you're with me

Only you can be
The aching in my heart, my enemy
The only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive

Only youI look in the mirror

I can't get over you
Is it someone?
Is it someone else?
Is it someone else?

I look in the mirror
And I try to see myself
My head full of terror
From the games I played so well
I try to see clearer
I try to forget the fires I started
I try to be nearer
To where you are
To where you are

Are we star crossed lovers?
Did I really want you gone?
If I'm really a winner
Where did these demons come from?

I was the girl who was on fire
I was the girl who was on fire
Only a bird could get much higher
(I look in the mirror)
'Cause I was the girl who was on fire

I look in the mirror
And I try to understand
And piece it together
Watch the blood from both my hands
I can't see the ending
There are people who know my every secret
I'm tired of pretending
You're in my heart
In my heart

Are we star crossed lovers?
Did I really want you gone?
If I'm really a winner
Where did these demons come from?

I was the girl who was on fire
I was the girl who was on fire
Only a bird could get much higher
(I look in the mirror)
'Cause I was the girl who was on fireI don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down

Next I thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you
You were talking deep, like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

Now I always hear always hear them talking
Talking about a girl, about a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you, but I don't still don't get it
You didn't love me, no not really

Wait, I could've really liked you
I bet, I bet that's why I keep on thinking about you
It's a shame, you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind

You got yourself in a dangerous zone
Because we both had the fear, fear of being alone
And I still don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And my heart don't understand it
Understand it, understand it
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebodyThat true love, it was taken away from us so young
We're summer kids
Without a song, we're fading in to oblivion
But we're still the one

We got our guard up and we're hung up on another loss
I need to summon all these demons keeping me on the floor
But now we're here and I am giving everything to you
Just say you need this, say you need me, say you want this too

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we do

That sadness kills

Don't let the past dictate the way you play it now
Don't play it down
The time is now
I know you're feeling what I feel, just let it show
Don't let it go

Somebody somewhere driving in their car is crying out
Forever running from the truth, sometimes all we have is doubt
But now we're here and I am giving all I can to you
Just say you love me, say you love me, say you want this too

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we do

No one does it like we do
No one does it like we do

Somebody somewhere driving in their car is crying out
Forever running from the truth, sometimes all we have is doubt
But now we're here and I am giving all I can to you
Just say you love me, say you love me, say you want this too

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we do

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we doI feel a lump in my throat
And this is far from joy

I never seem to learn
That high makes things harder
That high I get from you

I've figured out the joy is not in your arms
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart
I think it's time to run 'cause I'm seeing stars
I'm seeing stars watch me fall apart

I think of dying all the time
But I've got joy to take my side
Fear is my favourite

Oh, and then you'll seeI'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene

And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
Hes the only one for me, Jolene

I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
JoleneWhen everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight

I need your love
I need your love

I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart

I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight

I need your love
I need your love

Now I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong
I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong

And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight

I need your love
I need your love

All the years, all the times
You have never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing

And all the tears, all the lies
All the waste
I've been trying to make it change
And now my eyes are open

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be freeWhy when men look outside do they see houses,
Instead of the fields they grew from?
We are constantly uprooted from them, making us tiresome and fearful
Can you get up right now, endeavor to free-fall

'Cause you can fall if you want to 
It's just a matter of how far
You treasured our home town
But you've forgotten where you are
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found
And it has been found wandering around

With that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away
And I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed

Patterns all arranged in my background
These pillars and posts keeping this country on form
Letters were all sent with no addresses
So that people can't discover
We're always undercover
Why do I always draw triangles
Instead of words this paper so deserves?

'Cause you see
I don't own my clothes but I own my mind
And it's not what you've lost
But it's what you find.

You found that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away
And I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed

'Cause you can fall if you want to
It's just a matter of how far
You've treasured our home town
But you've forgotten where you are
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found
And it has been found wandering around

With that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away
And I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayedLike all the boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before,
Like all the boys, boys, boys

You left a blood stain on the floor
You set your sights on him
You left a hand print on the door
Like all the boys before,
Like all the boys before

This is our luck baby, running out
Our clothes were never off
We still have our roads to run about
To scale the map, scale the map,
To get us back on track

I've seen you in a fight you lost,
I've seen you in a fight

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
Your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me

Like all the boys before

In here the world won't bring us down
Our plan is gold dust
Out there a lonely girl could drown
In here we're frozen

Where did the people go?
My hands are empty
You're not the answer I should know
Like all the boys before, like all the boys
Before

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
Your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me

We're in a mess baby,
We're in a mess babe
Your more is less babe
We're in a mess baby,
We're in a mess babe
Your more is less babe

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
And your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
(I've seen you in a fight you lost)
Like all the boys before,
Like all the boys before

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
Our house full of paper,
And your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
Your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing meYou're living in the past it's a new generation
A girl can do what she wants to do and that's
What I'm gonna do
An' I don't give a damn ' bout my bad reputation

Oh no not me
No no no no no
Not me me me me me

An' I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation

An' I don't give a damn
'Bout my bad reputation

Oh no, not me

'Bout my bad reputation

Oh no, not me
Oh no, not
Not me, not meWasn't any war we couldn't win
We had unbreakable powers
When our bodies meet, it's everything
This was a beautiful vision
Even love was not a way you could describe it
And then there comes a collision
Nothing ever goes in the night

And they're not lost forever
Lost what once was here
It's now just sparks
Now the fireworks are fading
Is it over?
Lost you in the summer 

Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago

If there's no storm, why're we a shipwreck?
Thought our love is insurmountable
He knows my heart is still aching
Never thought it would be caused by you

We're not lost forever
Lost what once was here
It's now just  sparks
Now the fireworks are fading
Is it over?
Lost you in the summer 

Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Two years ago
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on

And the reason I can't forget is I think you do too
I know you think of me, too
I'll use this moment to really forget
I will soon, but for now
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you

Two years ago
About you
About you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
About you
About you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Two years ago
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving onSwore upon the sun I'd save you for a rainy day
Loosen the noose then let go of the rope
I know if it's never coming back, it has to go

I keep calling your name (Keep calling your name)
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed
So I keep calling at night (Keep calling at night)
I wanna hold you close, I just never wanna hold you tight

Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms

I've found the weakness and put it to play
Swore upon the stars I'd keep you till the night was day
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know
You said if you're never coming back you have to go

I keep calling your name (Keep calling your name)
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed
So I keep calling at night (Keep calling at night)
I wanna hold you close, I just never wanna hold you tight

Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms

Oh my goodness, here I go again
Pulling you back to me
Pulling you back into my arms so selfishly
I don't think I understand, 'cause I don't really know myself
I keep calling you up, calling you up
Calling you up
Calling you up
Calling you up
(So, I can call)Years of too much thought and time I wasted
And in each line upon my face
Is proof I fought and lived another day

When did life become this place of madness?
Drifting on an empty sea of waves and sadness?
I make believe I'm in control
And dream it wasn't all my fault

When your feet don't touch the ground
When your voice won't make a sound
Here, it's safe
In this place
Up off the clouds
When your feet don't touch the earth
You can't feel the fates that hurt
And you're free
There's no need 
To come down
When your feet don't touch the ground

Everyday just feels a little longer
Why am I the only one not getting stronger?
Running around pretending life's a play
It doesn't make the darkness go away

I may be young but I can still remember
Feeling full of joy, crying tears of laughter
Now all my tears are all cried out
Make-believe, but count me out

'Cause my feet are on the ground
And the inner voice I found
Tells the truth, "There's no use,
if your head's in the clouds"
With my feet on solid earth
I can face the fates that hurt
And in time
I'll be fine
I'll come 'round

I was once like you
Life was a maze
I couldn't find my way out
But what I say is true
You will be amazed
Make-believe and you will find out that it's true

When your feet don't touch the ground
When your voice won't make a sound
Here, it's safe
In this place
Up off the clouds
When your feet don't touch the earth
You can't feel the fates that hurt
And you're free
There's no need 
To come down
When your feet don't touch the groundI had a heart then, but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up the strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone



Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place the only time I feel safe

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone





You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

Home, home


Home, home


Home, home


Home, homeYou know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Every day I feel this pain
But you just turn and walk away

No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong
With you and me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Touch me and then turn away
And put your hands into the flame
Tell me if you feel this pain
'Cause I don't wanna be a ball and chain

No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong






Yeah, give me the respect
Forgive me and forget
I've gotta get a grip
Living on the edge

I barely even know this fuckin' woman in my bed
And if there's too much on my plate, then I ain't finishing my veg
And if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side
Well it ain't, swear on my mother's life
You got me wrapped up in your shit, I'm feeling mummified
I've only had this fuckin' feeling in my stomach twice


(To you and)


You gave me what I needed
And I gave her everything she wanted
There's something about your cleavage
Now I can't put my fingers on it
You're taking me the deepest
I thought she was gonna vomit
If all women from Venus
Then I guess I really got a rocket

You've got a noose around my neck but I'm still hanging on
We've nearly reached the finish line up in our marathon
I spat a verse, she sang a song
She broke my heart I took some Gaviscon


I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me, with you and me, with you andYou're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've gotta find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire

Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Yeah yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do (Ah)
What are you waiting for?And I walked a thousand miles to prove it
And I'm caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts
The colour of my blood is all I see on the rocks
As you sail from me

Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me
My bones will bleach, my flesh will flee
So, help my lifeless frame to breathe

And God knows I'm not dying but I breathe now
And God knows it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew

The lost dreams I buried in my sleep for him
And this was the ecstasy of love forgotten
And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets
And my blood is all I see
As you steal my soul from me

Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me

And God knows I'm not dying but I breathe now
And God knows it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew

And God knows I'm not dying but I breathe now
And God knows it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew

And God knows I'm not dying but I breathe now
And God knows It's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you (I lost with you, I lost with you)
It drowns the love I thought I knew (I thought I knew, I thought I knew)You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything

For what it's worth
For what it's worth
For what it's worth
You were my backbone when my body ached with weariness
You were my hold down when my heart was filled with loneliness
And just as the dark was rising I heard you close the door again
And just as the light turned south I knew who I dream of

Could've given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything

You are my only hope
The truth, the dare, the consequence
I know you don't feel the same you're sensible and it doesn't make sense
I know I'm gonna wait my heart out you know I'm gonna try much harder
But it isn't the shit in my head that's holding me under this time

Could've given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything

You my everything
You my everything
You my everything

You my everything
You my everything
You my everything

Could've given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything
You my everything
You my everythingI was just lonely
I was just in need of a friend
Spend your days
Thinking if only
Thinking if only you and me made sense

For any love
Quit the pain you feel
You won't let it go
You won't let it heal
Baby, it's clear
You don't know me
You don't know me

And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal

It's in your eyes
I can see that you're broken
I know you're lost because I am too
It's in your voice
I hear you choking
When did the illusion take the truth

I think you're in love
With the pain you feel
You won't let it go
You won't let it heal
Baby, it's clear
You don't even know me
You don't even know me

And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal

You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out
It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love you've given now
You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out
It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love you've given now

And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal
Heal
HealWith wounded lips and salted cheeks
And finally we step to leave
To the departure lounge of disbelief
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
And I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine bitter sunlight

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

Before daylight

In the canyon underneath the trees
Behind the dark sky, you looked at me
I fell for you like autumn leaves
Never faded, evergreen
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
'Cause I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine bitter sunlight

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

I can't face this, now everything has changed
I just wanna be by your side
Here's hoping we collide, here's hoping we collide
Here's hoping we collide

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

I wanna hear your beating heart tonightYou never let me give up
All the nights and the fights
And the blood and the breakups
You're always there to call up
I'm a pain, I'm a child, I'm afraid
And yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
I know that we don't look like much
But no one fucks it up like us

16 and you never even judged me
Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me
Sitting there in the caravan
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor
And yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

Dark times, you could always find the bright side
I'm amazed by the things that you would sacrifice
Just to be there for me
How you cringe when you sing out of tune
And yeah it's everything
So don't change a thing
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
(I'll be yours)
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
I'm standing with an army

Yet you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
They don't have a chance either

Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing near you
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
When I'm with you
Standing with an armyWhen I watched you disappear
When you made me stop believing
I could fight away the fear

Now the smoke has cleared and the end is near, it was my illusion
Like a broken dream, I was incomplete
But your love was never the missing piece

I feel like I'm breathing again
I feel like I'm seeing again
I feel like I'm breathing again
I got it under control-ol-ol
I got it under control-ol-ol
I got it under control-ol-ol

All that's real is faded
Like a car into the night
Like a painkiller, I take it
And I watch the world igniteThese haters couldn't get to where I am with a full tank of petrol, uh
My uncle used to drink a can of kestrel when life got stressful, uh
What kinda person should you be when wanna make people accept you, uh
What does it really mean when you dream of being famous and successful,
When you were born to be special,
Uh yeh and I went from the kid in class,
Text some radio DJs so they could bring me up
To the young rapper that everybody's ringing up,
Got em looking for a sprinkle of that pixie dust
Mad thoughts in my head when its blowin up
Like, are you really big enough?
I traded friends for fans
Cement for sand
Raise your hand 
The wonderman

[Ellie Goulding]
See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the wonderman)
I saw the chosen one their calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The wonderman

[Tinie Tempah]
Bored of being nameless
Bored of feeling awkward
When you walk up in the mall and cant afford a pair of trainers,
Imagine when it changes, imagine satisfaction when you make it,
Its more than being famous,
More then the applause and more than any form of status,
More than the performances in 20 foreign places,
Benidorm, Vegas, many more praises,
Amen hallelujah "Tinie look what's happened to ya?"
Yeh they love that attitude brand new and improved, yeh

And when the fans start grabbing you,
Show gratitude with a little brag or two,
Amen, hallelujah Tinie look what's happened to ya,
Who can say they ran all the obstacles I ran, look
I traded friends for fans, 
Cement for sand, 
Raise your hand, 
The wonderman

[Ellie Goulding - Chorus]
See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the wonderman)
I saw the chosen one their calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The wonderman

Come on come on the stars are where you belong
Come on come on follow your heart is gunna take you home
Come on come on the stars are where you belong
There's no turning back from here

See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the wonderman)
I saw the chosen one their calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The wondermanLie next to your frame, girl unobserved
You change your position and you're changing me
Casting these shadows where they shouldn't be

We're interrupted by the heat of the sun
Trying to prevent what's already begun
You're just a body, I can smell your skin
And when I feel it, you're wearing thin

But I've got a plan

Why don't you be the artist
And make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer
And decide the words I say?

Because I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it’s too hard to ask
Won't you try to help me?

Sat on your sofa, it's all broken springs
This isn't the place for those violin strings
I try out a smile and I aim it at you
You must have missed it, you always do

But I've got a plan

Why don't you be the artist
And make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer
And decide the words I say?

Because I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it’s too hard to ask
Won't you try to help me?

You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted
You wait, I wait, casting shadows

Why don't you be the artist
And make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer
And decide the words I say?

Because I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it’s too hard to ask
Won't you try to help me?

Why don't you be the artist
And make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer
And decide the words I say?

Because I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it’s too hard to ask
Won't you try to help me?A silent heart ticking under the ground
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found
If you hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after all

A silent heart ticking under the ground
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found
If you hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after all

A silent heart ticking under the ground
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found
If you hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after all

A silent heart ticking under the ground
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found
If you hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after allIt starts with a picture and it sits in your frame
And we part with a letter and it ends in my name
And it starts with forever and it ends with a touch
And I know that you're clever and I don't ask for much



Maybe we forgot all the things we are
When we are together



You said I'm arresting, you said I had heat
I really thought that we'd go further the second time we meet
'Cause I'm tired of trying to keep you - all I want to do is sleep
And perhaps when I'm sleeping you'll get back on your feet



Maybe we forgot all the thing we are
When we are together

Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest
It's not so hard every time you go





I run out to meet you when I knew the storm had come
And I felt the rain on your face and the damage you had done
I know what you're thinking - it will never be the end
And when the storm is over, you won't see me again



Didn't know the price I'd paid for all the times I stayed
When we were together

Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest
It's not so hard

()
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
()
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
()
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
Or maybe we forgot

Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest

Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest
It's not so hard every time you goI need a helping hand, just to beat the void
I need a mission, a dream to stop me talking to myself
And now the silence is broken, now my soul is to sell
I need to pick up the pieces, to scatter to the wind
Hold the city to your ears, you can hear the waves come in

You can't change the world with a song
And you can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me
Wherever I go, it's playing for you
I can't stop this voice unravelling 'round of me
Whatever I do, it's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart
Beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me, believe, believe, believe me

Don't let it slip through your fingertips
When there's a ghost, don't try to reason with it
'Cause now I'm tired, I'm wired, so I won't miss a thing
I wrote my words up to dry, and I've forgotten what to sing

But you can't change the world with a song
You can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me
Wherever I go, it's playing for you
I can't stop this voice unravelling 'round of me
Whatever I do, it's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart
Beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me, believe, believe, believe me

If that's what it was to you
Then that's what it was to me
If that's what it was to you
Then that's what it was to me
If that's what it was to you
Then that's what it was to me

But you can't change the world with a song
You can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me
Wherever I go, it's playing for you
I can't stop this voice unravelling 'round of me
Whatever I do, it's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart
Beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me

Believe, believe, believe me
Believe, believe, believe meIf you never said anything?
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never said anything?

If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never

Here it is in my hands
In my veins and over lands
It spreads like fire, seeking air
To pull me in my own fanfare

Won't you come, won't you come
Won't you come, just don't say a word
Won't you come, won't you come
Won't you come, just don't say a word

If you never, if you never
Just don't say a word
If you never, if you never
Just don't say a word

I'm more alive than I've ever been
So, now I give you all my sins
Chosen you, I've chosen you
But don't say a word

And if I save us and I fall down
I will leave your words behind now
If you never held me under
If you never hear my thunderThis love is like fire and ice
This love is like rain and blue skies
This love is like sun on the rise
This love got me rolling the dice
Don't let me lose
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

Beautiful mind
Your heart got a story with mine
Your heart got me hurting at times
Your heart gave me new kind of highs
Your heart got me feeling so fine
So what to do
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

It took us a while
With every breath a new day
With love on the line
We've had our share of mistakes
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for you

Brighter than gold
This love shining brighter than gold
This love is like letters in bold
This love is like out of control
This love is never growing old
You make it new
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

It took us a while
Because we were young and unsure
With love on the line
What if we both would need more
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for you

Falling, crash into my arms
Love you like this
Like a first kiss
Never let go
Falling, crash into my arms
Never breaking what we got
Still falling for you
Still falling for...

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
All for me

And just like that
All I feel is you
All I feel is you
You are all for me
I'm still falling...
And just like that
All I feel is you
All I feel is you
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for youBite chunks out of me
You're a shark and I'm swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed
Now your friends come sniffing

Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go, my love, it's very late
Till morning comes, let's tessellate

Go alone my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones alone, my lover
And keep us on my heart

Three guns and one goes off
One's empty, one's not quick enough
One burn, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins

Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning, they'll nosh you up
Yes, they'll nosh the love away, but it's fair to say
You will still haunt me

Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go, my love, it's very late
Till morning comes

Wild green stones alone my lover
Keep us on my heartWhen you played the thief and I played the fool
Gonna make you move, make you move, make you move
Been so long crying over you
Now I'm coming your way
Gonna make you move, gonna make you move, make you move, make you move

Chasing faces in the sand
Now your dagger is in my hand
I'll make you move, I'll make you move, I'll make you move

I'll make you run faster, faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way 'cause I can't lose
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way
I'm coming through

I'll make you run fa-, I'll make you run fa-
I'll make you run fa-, I'll make you run fa-

Coming down on you with a flashing light
There's nowhere to run maybe you can't hide
Gonna make you move, make you move, make you move

It's too late now the tables turned
There's no going back and you'll never learn
Unless I make you move, I make you move, I make you move

And you think I'm still broken hearted
But you'll never win the war you started
You'd better open your eyes

Faster , faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way 'cause I can't lose
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster

Get out of my way, get out of my way

And you think I'm still broken hearted
But you'll never win the war you started
You'd better open your eyes

I'll make you run
I'll make you run
I'll make you run
I'll make you run

Fears overplayed
Two left feet emergency. 

Wide open space 
Catch my tail, 
fishing net. 
Fold up my frown 
take the rage 
and smooth it out. 

Stick to my skin, 
paper mache face to live in. 
Same view to paint, 
Watercolour your name 

Face your mistakes 
(You will never have to feel that way again) 
Oil your chains, under rate. 
(You will never have to feel that way again) 
Read every page, 
Press the dents, fighter plane 

I held the fort, and I swung my sword I have muted the screams I have broken the falls oh I have fought, and I swung my sword I have muted the screams I have broken the falls 

Fighter Plane 
Fly away!Show the bruises on your skin
Let the fires all burn out
I can hear the silent shout in you

Let it go don't be so scared
Find the love you lost again
Let the chaos disappear
Don't you know I'm always here for you

Cause this is devotion
I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion
I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
Cause this is devotion

Tell me what you dream about
I lose you in my sleep, somehow
Let the chaos disappear
Don't you know I'm always there for you

Cause this is devotion
I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion
I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
Cause this is devotion

Cause this is devotion
I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion
I am caught
Floating in your gravity

Cause this is devotion
I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion
I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
Cause this is devotionBecause over pain love is outgrown
I've never won a fight to understand
I just move as my heart commands

I've always had a thing for silence
But lately I just need a voice I recognise
Baby, it's perfect timing now to

Scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
So scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down

Have you found peace with your mistakes
Breathing on the glass as it breaks?
Have you found the words to save her
And keep your heart out of danger?

I don't think I can take the violence
And lately I just need a voice I recognise
Baby, it's perfect timing now to

Scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
So scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down

I've always had a thing for silence
But lately I just need a voice I recognise
Baby, it's perfect timing now to

Scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
So scream it out, out
I won't let you down, downI'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
See I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world

If I was a sculptor, but then again no
Or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the worldFeels unused
I've never met anyone like you

Frightening
Feeling naked
Sensing, searching something sacred

I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll look for you, baby

Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

Go
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

I'm exhausted with loving
No fight in me, I'm defeated
I know I'm fooled, I can't help it
You make my heart so helpless

I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll look for you
For you, maybeYou drove me off the road

But you let go 'cause your hope is gone
And every question fades away

It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time to hear you heart's false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
Well, you know this is your biggest mistake

You tread water
Fighting for the air in your lungs
Move, move closer
Maybe you can right all your wrongs

But you let go 'cause your hope is gone
And every answer fades away

It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time to hear your heart's false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
Well, you know this is your biggest mistake

Wipe the mud stains from the face, stop the engine
Yeah, stop pretending
Wipe the mud spray from your face, stop the engine
Yeah, stop pretending that you're still breathing

It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time to hear your heart's false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
Well, you know this is your biggest mistake

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
You know this is your biggest mistakeAs long as stars are above you
And longer if I can

How long will I need you?
As long as the seasons need to
Follow their plan

How long will I be with you?
As long as the sea is bound to
Wash up on the sand

How long will I want you?
As long as you want me to
And longer by far

How long will I hold you?
As long as your father told you
As long as you can

How long will I give to you?
As long as I live through you
However long you say

How long will I love you?
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I may

How long will I love you?
As long as stars are above youTread floors you don't fall through 
Make waves, you crash a cymbal hard 
Follow no one, always play the wrong card
 
Waste days, in foreign places 
Shed light, on your better side 
Reassure me that you'll wait for me
Wait for me as long as it takes 

And I'll hold my breath, I'll hold my breath 

Until you see me in your dreams 
We'll stay awake beneath the trees 
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust 
A sky of diamonds just for us
You are the risk I'll always take 
The only branch I'll never break 
Those fears, we'll blow them all way 
We'll blow them all away 

Fight fires in your best clothes 
Touch skin with your eyes closed 
Chase thunder, with the volume down 
Pack a suitcase, wander to the next town 

Force quit, on your losing streak 
Solve a riddle in a magazine, be tongue in cheek 
Tell me that we're still too young
That we're still too young and I'll hold my tongue 

Until you see me in your dreams 
We'll stay awake beneath the trees 
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust 
A sky of diamonds just for us 
You are the risk I'll always take 
The only branch I'll never break 
Those fears, we'll blow them all way 
We'll blow them all away 

I'm here, I'm here to take you 
I'll swim, I will swim to save you 
No fall, I'm here to catch you 
I'll swim, I will swim to save you 

Until you see me in your dreams 
We'll stay awake beneath the trees 
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust 
A sky of diamonds just for us 
You are the risk I'll always take 
The only branch I'll never break 
Those fears, we'll blow them all way 
We'll blow them all awayIf you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out

Me out

I'm living on the wild side
I've never seen a footprint
In the land of rivers
You're my only bridge
And I feel the fear in me
And I don't wanna fall asleep
When I turn into someone else
I know that it can't be beat

If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock 
If you lock
If you lock 
If you lock 
If you lock me

Will you know I am?
(If you lock me)
Will you know you are?
(If you lock me)
Will you know I am?
(If you lock me)
Will you know you are?

I think I've been praying
The lights won't go out
My body's getting colder
As I follow this road down

If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold on)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold on)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the ending)Into me push it deep
Wash the dirt, a hard day's work, know my place

On my own
No poison in my bones
On my own
This is where I build my home

My home
This will always be my home
This will always be my home

I work until it's late
Walk in and closed the gate
I look in the window and gaze at my face

Every line and every abrasion
This took my life to make
This took my life to make

On my own
No poison in my bones
On my own
This is where I build my home

My home
My home

I need someone to hold
I need someone to hold

My home
This will always be my home
This will always be my homeYou left me with your open hands
I never knew what I had to do

Stumbling out in the dark
You left me with a question mark
You said the bridges had to be burned

And it's a pain that only we know
Oh and you lost all on your own
Always has to be a new scare
To keep us falling over the edge

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
Because you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise

There's a place we try to reach
Impossible as it would seem
I heard you crying out in your sleep

I see that look you save for me
I pull you back upon your feet
I know you always need something more, more

And it's a thing that only we know
Oh and you lost all on your own
Always has to be a new scare
To keep us falling over the edge

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
Because you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise, paradise
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise

I know we're headed for a moment, baby
We made sense of it
I know I struck you so reckless, honey
We gave into it
(Paradise)

I know we're headed for a moment, baby
We made sense of it
(Paradise)
I know I struck you so reckless, honey
We gave in

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
Because you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise, paradise,
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise.Who are we to play with hearts? 
And throw away it all 
Who are we to turn each others heads? 
Who are we to find ourselves in other people's beds? 
I don't like the way I never listen to myself 
I feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help 

I don't think you know me much at all 

This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 
I'm feeling down about this love 

Who are you to make me feel so good? 
Who are we to tell ourselves that we're misunderstood? 
Oh who am I to say I'm always yours 
Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores 
I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart 
Now we're falling on each other like we're always in the dark 

I don't think you warned me much at all 

This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 

This love is not what you want 
This heart will never be yours 
This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 

This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 

You're so quiet 
But it doesn't faze me 
You're on time 
You move so fast 
Makes me feel lazy 

And let's join forces 
We've got our guns and horses 
I know you've been burnt 
But every fire is a lesson learnt 

I left my house 
Left my clothes 
Door wide open 
Heaven knows 
You're so worth it, you are 

But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you 
I would, I would, I would, I would, I would 

Let’s tie words 
'Cause they amount to nothing 
Play it down 
Pretend you can't take what you've found 
But you found me 
On a screen you sit at permanently 

I left my house 
Left my clothes 
Door wide open 
Heaven knows 
You're so worth it, you are 

But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you 
I would, I would, I would, I would 

It's time to come clean and make sense of everything 
It's time that we found out who we are 
'Cause when I'm standing here in the dark 
I see your face in every star 

But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you 
I would, I would, I would, I would, I would 

I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you 

I had a way then 
Losing it all on my own 
I had a heart then 
But the queen has been overthrown 
And I'm not sleeping now 
The dark is too hard to beat 
And I'm not keeping up 
The strength I need to push me 

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 

Noises, I play within my head 
Touch my own skin 
And hope they'll still be there 
And I think back to when 
My brother and my sister slept 
In another place 
The only time I feel safe 

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 

Lights, lights
Lights, lights

Lights, lights

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 

Home, home 
(Lights, lights, lights)... 

You're as sharp as a knife and you fit like a glove 
That is no way to live that is no way to love 
Full of fear in your skin and the weakness in giving in 

Stabbed in the back but you feel no pain 
Push the heaviest doors that you can't open 
Yeah they tied me up and my body lies still, again 

You're as bright as the sun and as bold as the moon 
I don't know when you'll break but it's gonna be soon 
If my will caves in, I'll be in the same boat as you 

I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 

He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
Created just to understand
"The meaning of" 

Hands on strings and my mouth open 
Find the perfect words that I've not spoken 
And I won't tell the truth unless you want me to 

For all of the times that I lost my head 
When it rolled to the floor and I found it again 
But when it came back, 
I didn't know my own name 

I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 

He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
Created just to understand
"The meaning of" 

I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 

He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
Created just to understand 

I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 

He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
created just to understand... 
"the meaning of" 

Oh, oh, starry eyed 
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning 

Handle bars 
That I let go, let go 
For anyone 
Take me in 
And I'll throw out my heart 
And get a new one 

Next thing, we're touching 
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning 

Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And everybody glows 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And my body goes 

So we burst 
Into colours 
Colours 
And carousels 
Fall head first 
Like paper planes and playground games 

Next thing, we're touching 
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning 

Oh

Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys

You left your blood stain on the floor 
You set your sights on him 
You left a hand print on the door, 
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before (boys boys boys boys) 

This is our luck, baby, running out 
Her clothes were never off 
We still have hours to run about 
To scale the map, scale the map, to get us back on track 
I've seen you in a fight you lost, I’ve seen you in a fii-ii-ii-ii-ght 

Were under the sheets and you're killing me 
In our house made of paper, your words all over me 
Were under the sheets and you’re killin me 

Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys

In here the world won’t bring us down 
Our plan is golden 
Out there a lonely girl could drown 
In here were frozen 

Where did the people go? 
My hands are empty 
You're not the answer I should know 
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before 
(whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,) 

Were in a mess baby, were in a mess babe 
Your more is less babe (oh, oh) 
Were in a mess baby, were in a mess babe 
Your more is less babe (oh, oh!) 

Were under the sheets and you're killin me 
In our house made of paper, and you're words all over me 
We're under the sheets and you’re killin' me 
(I've seen you in a fight you lost) 
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before 
Were under the sheets and your killing me 
Our house full of paper and you're words all over me 
Were under the sheets and you’re killing me 
(Oh you’re killin me, your killin me!!) 

Were under the sheets and you're killing me 
In our house made of paper, your words all over me 
Were under the sheets and you’re killin me 
(killin me, killin me, killin me) 
Killin me, killin me, killin me 

Oh, oh, starry eyed

I see you're sorry how I'm burning down the gun
With a war in your mind that never wants to be won
I catch you in a light no one else can see
I know you see her, and you'll never see me
She makes you feel the most, keep your souls alive
But what we had, it never really died

And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth
But here's to us, here's to us, here's to us

Yeah, this is just a phase, pretty sure of that
And one day, you and I, we will never look back
You kept me in the flames but the fire was out, the fire was out

And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth

Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh

And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth
But here's to us, here's to us, here's to usBaby I worked this out for sure
It's gonna be colder
Now you've forced open the door
I know you better
Than I ever have before
I know you

I know you're a fighter
But you never fought for me
When I was a shelter
But you're not heading home to me
We could be closer
We could be closer
We could be

When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

It's gonna be (It's gonna be better)
And it's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, oh, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better

We'll take a long walk
Down the alleys of these houses
And we'll talk
See what conversation rouses
When we're alone
When we're alone
It could be home

When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

It's gonna be (It's gonna be better)
And it's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, oh, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be better

It's gonna be (It's gonna be better)
And it's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, oh, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be betterWe don't have to worry about nothing

Girl in the world...But it doesn't faze me
You're on dial
You move so fast, makes me feel lazy

Let's join forces
We've got our guns and horses
I know you've been burned
But every fire is a lesson learned

I left my house
Left my clothes
Door wide open, heaven knows
That you're so worth it, you are

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Then maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you, I would

Let's type words
Because they amount to nothing
Play it down
Pretend you can't take what you found
But you found me
On a screen you sit at permanently

I left my house
Left my clothes
Door wide open, heaven knows
You're so worth it, you are

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you, I would

It's time to come clean,
And make sense of everything
It's time that we found out who we are
'Cause when I'm standing here in the dark
I see your face in every star

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you, I would
I'd do it all for youI wouldn't even flinch
I couldn't try to move
My mind is on you
My mind is on you

If the street lights smashed above me
I wouldn't move an inch
Turn the glass into stars
And your face is the moon

And the night turns to you
'Cause my mind is on you

You got me caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what
I can take anything
I can take anything
I can take anything

If electric charges shock me
I'd smile and fold my arms
I'd feel nothing new
Because my mind is on you
Ooh, my mind is on you
Ooh...

And if the floor gave way to my shoes
I wouldn't try to fly
I can't explain why
I always feel
Always feel you
I always feel
Always feel you

You got me caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what
I can take anything

You're the heat in my bones
Would you break my with stones?
You're the heat in my bones
But you break my with your stones

If a plane crashed into my room
I wouldn't even flinch
I couldn't try to move
My mind is always on you
My mind is always on you

Caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what

Even when I'm caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what
I can take anythingIs that too much to ask
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask

When I look into your eyes
Boy, I'm feeling delirious
But you know this is serious
I'm sticking to you like glue
Only see you now and then, but I know we could have it all
Because before I was cynical, baby you were just cool

I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong
I could be, I could be, I could be there
If only you'd let me in, I could be there
Just tell me where and tell me when
So tired of these roads going nowhere
But I know your love takes me somewhere

Still looking up and down while you're being mysterious
I see really big things for us
We just need to break through, break through, break through
Everything that you say, god I wish I had said it first
And forgetting I had ever hurt
Your love is pulling me through, me through, me through

I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong

You are all I want
So take me home
The more you been thinking about us
Open up, don't let me go
The more you been thinking about

I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong
I could be there
If only you'd let me in, I could be there
Just tell me where and tell me when
So tired of these roads going nowhere
But I know your love takes me somewhereLips like Tanqueray
Tropical sunrises, never sleeping
I don't know what changed

All I want to do is feel the rhythm of the night
You've been running from the dark
You can't look me in the eyes
Being called into the heat
Even if it's burning me
I just need to dance without you

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
You're not in love

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss

Through the streets and all the places I've been
I can see we never had harmony
I won't go even though I'm alone and I know I want out

I go up without you bringing me down
Such a rush
So now I'm staying to dance on my own
On my own
And all I know is

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
You're not in love

We don't even kiss

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy

It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
You're not in love

Now I'm giving you up tonight
Now I'm giving you up tonight

Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away, I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up

Ride around, ride around

You ride around in that H-town
If there's candles near your bed, no need for a spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First go through my legs, go back on your head
And whatever you want, yeah baby I'll bet it comes true

Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm the problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted

Yo, baby, what's all this you telling everybody 
We broke up and all this, I'm hearin' off the streets and all, that, ma 
Talk to me or something, huh, I don't know what's goin' on, baby 
You know, I got my clothes in the joint, and you go up here 
Just packin' my gear --- what happened boo?) 

I can't believe I believed, everything we had would last 
So young and naive for me to think, she was from your past 
Silly of me to dream of, one day having your kids 
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong 
I can't believe I fell for four years, and I'm smarter than that 
So young and naive to believe that with me, you're a changed man 
Foolish of me to compete, when you cheat with loose women 
It took me some time but now I moved on, cuz I realized I got 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

So controlling, you said that you love me, but you don't 
Your family told me one day, I would see it on my own 
Next thing I know I'm dealing, with your three kids and my home 
I've been so blind, it feels right when it's wrong 
Now that it's over, stop calling me, come pick up your clothes 
No need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know 
Even your very best friend, tried to warn me on the low 
It took me some time, but now I am strong 
Because I realized I got.. 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

I got me, myself and I (I know that I would never dissapoint myself) 
Must have cried a thousand times (all the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out) 
I can't regret time spent with you (yeah, you hurt me but I learned a lot the long way) 
But I lucked out to make it through (after all the rain you see the sun come out again) 

See that's why you in my life right now, smile right now.. 
I'm sorry, boo... I'm sorry.. 
Just you know, that you got mature... shoot.. 
Ya'll ladies keep your mouth shut right now 
Cuz ya'll don't know what y'all talking about 
This between me and her, that's my word, she just upset 

Changes... we all go through changes 
Arguments, disagreements, and to some it's dangerous 
But your mind and your heart's clogged with all your pain and 
But a bond that we was holding, what made us famous 
Hey miss, beautiful mami with tears of stone 
Stop cryin', come talk to Tone 
Tell me everything that's goin' wrong like your needs and doubts 
My reason for coming in late, I need cheese and sprouts 
So I could continue to hold down the foundation 
It's pitiful how you could charge me with violations 
Patience is the key, fuck the frustrations 
We act off our emotions and we start hatin' 
And that leads to stress, problems and weight loss 
Total baldness, broke homes come from negative forces 
Baby be cautious, you got to call the cops to get me out 
When it come, babe, I'm goin' all out 
It's T-O-N-E-Y, to Beyonce, my, sweetie pie 
Please try, be mine til we die 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

Do you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup...

On my mind up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is, we should get married
We should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine

Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

Do you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup...

From 8 until late, I think 'bout you
You're all my nights I don't know what to do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way too deep and we should

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

So go on, go home

But heaven couldn't wait for you

En la tierra como en el cielo
AmenWell, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I need your halo (halo) halo
I need your halo (halo) halo
I need your halo (halo) halo
I needyour halo (halo) halo
Whoa

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo (halo) halo

Pray it won't fade away

When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row

How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love you're doing no one else can

When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
They assure me, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress

The way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now

you stepped to me and then you said to me 
I was the women you dreamed about 
remember the first day when you called my house 
remember the first day  when you took me out 
we had butterflies
although we tried to hide it
and we both had a beautiful night
the way we held each others hands 
the way we talked 
the way we laughed 
it felt so good to find true love 
I knew right then and there you were the one
ohhh 
I know that he loves me cause he told me so 
I know that he loves me cause his feelings show 
when he stares at me 
you see he cares for me 
you see how he's so deep in love 
I know that he loves me cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts 
and he's missin me  
if he's not kissin me 
and when he looks at me 
his brown eyes tell his soul
remember the first day, the first day we kissed 
remember the first day we had an arguement 
we apologized and then we compromised 
and we haven't argued since 
remember the first day we stopped playing games 
remember the first day you fell in love with me 
it felt so good for you to say those words 
cause I felt the same way too 


the way we held each others hands 
the way we talked 
the way we laughed 
it felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one 
ohhhh 

I know that he loves me cause he told me so 
I know that he loves me cause his feelings show 
when he stares for me, you see he cares for me 
you see how he's so deep in love 
I know that he loves me cause it's obvious 
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts 
and he's missin me 
if he's not kissin me 
and when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soul
I'm so happy 
so happy that your in my life
and baby now that your a part of me 
you've showed me 
showed me the true meaning of love 
and I know he loves me

and he's missin me 
if he's not kissin me 
and when you looks at me 
his brown eyes tell his soul 
and when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soulBut after a while sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what's gets so confusing baby
You and me
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me

Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

Won't you just assume he doesn't care
To internalize it all isn't fare
So I address the problem so that he's aware
But I still feel all alone even when he's there
Maybe we can fix it baby
I know we can
If I make you miss it baby
Then maybe you will understand

That I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa

Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me companyOut in the darkness with no guide 
I know the cost of a losing hand 
There but for the grace of God go I 

I found heaven on earth 
You were my last, my first 
And then I hear this voice inside 
Ave Maria 

I've been alone 
When I'm surrounded by friends 
How could the silence be so loud 
But I still go home knowing that I've got you 
There's only us when the lights go down 

You are my heaven on earth 
You are my hunger, my thirst 
I always hear this voice inside 
Singing Ave Maria 

Sometimes love can come and pass you by 
While your busy making plans 
Suddenly hit you and then you realize 
It's out of your hands, baby you got to understand 

You are my heaven on earth 
You are my last, my first 
And then I hear this voice inside 
Ave Maria 
Ave Maria 
Ave Mariaay

Hey!

He said I'm worth it
his one desire
(I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about)
He kissed me
his one and only
this beautiful liar
(Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about)

We'll never know
why are we the ones who suffer?
have to let go
he won't be the one to cry

[Chorus]:
Let's not kill the karma
let's not start a fight
it's not worth the drama for a beautiful liar
can't we laugh about it
ha ha
it's not worth our time
oh
we can live without him just a beautful liar

I trusted him, but when I followed you
I saw you together
(I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again)
I walked in 
on your love scene
slow dancing
(you stole everything how can you say I did you wrong?)

We'll never know
when the pain and heartbreak's over
have to let go
the innocence is gone

[Chorus]

Tell me how to forgive you
when it's me who's ashamed
and I wish I could free you
of the hurt and the pain
but the answer is simple-
he's the one to blame

Some women, were made 
But me, myself
I like to think that I was created 
For a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you, you feel me? 

It's on, baby let's get lost 
You don't need to call into work, 'cuz you the boss 
For real, want you to show me how you feel 
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal 

Why, well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets
You didn't know was inside,
No need for me to lie

It's too big 
It's too wide 
It's too strong 
It won't fit 
It's too much 
It's too tough 
He talk like this 
'Cuz he can back it up 
He got a big ego 
Such a huge ego 
I love his big ego 
It's too much 
He walk like this 
'Cuz he can back it up 

Usually I'm humble
Right now I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find 
On what I'm working with 
Damn I know, I'm killing you with them legs 
Better yet them thighs 
Matter a fact it's my smile 
Or maybe my eyes 
Boy you a sight to see 
Kind of something like me 

It's too big 
It's too wide 
It's too strong 
It won't fit 
It's too much 
It's too tough 
I talk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 
I got a big ego 
Such a huge ego 
But he love my big ego 
It's too much 
I walk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 
I, I walk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 
I, I talk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 
I, I can back it up 
I can back it up 
I walk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 

It's too big 
It's too wide 
It's too strong 
It won't fit 
It's too much 
It's too tough 
He talks like this 
'Cuz he can back it up 
He got a big ego 
Such a huge ego 
I love his big ego 
It's too much 
He walks like this 
'Cuz he can back it up

And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way

Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
Well every promise don't work out that way, no, no, babe
Well every promise don't work out that way

And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no, no, no, no, no
Every promise don't work out that wayBy the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hail'd
At the twilight's
last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes
And bright stars
Thro' the perilous fight

O'er the ramparts we watch'd
Were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof thro' the night
That our flag was still there
O say
Does that star-spangled banner
Yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave?Best foot first just in case
When we made our way till now
It's time to listen, it's time to fight

Forward
Now we're going to hold doors open for a while
Now we can be open for a while

Forward
I love you more than this job, please don't work for me

Forward
Go back to your sleep in your favorite spot just next to me
Forward, forwardBitch, I'm back by popular demand

To have ya'll hatin on me,
when I don't have nothin' to prove.
Sometimes I shake my head,
when I'm layin' down in my bed.
Thinkin' 'bout the things been said,
when you really don't know me yet.

Gotta clear up some things
there have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved.
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya,
give it a rest.
You must admire me,
spend so much time with me consuming your head.

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out.
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies.
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh

It's really been weighing on me,
i'm not myself lately.
I feel a little incomplete,
but i'm not gonna lose no sleep.
I keep it all in my mind,
cause it gotta get better in time.
Why don't you live your life?
And let me live mine.

The way that you protect your friends 
Baby, I respect you for that 
And when you roll you take everyone you love along 
I love that shit

But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
(If I let you go)
Sit in the house off the coast
(If I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

She gon' rock the V.V.S. stones
(If I let you go)
Cruise in the 'Bach or the Rolls
(If I let you go)
She gon' pocket everything I tote
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers
Accusations, what you mean you gon' choke?

You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spendin' yo' dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture-perfect movie everyone would have saw

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
(If I let you go)
Sit in the house off the coast
(If I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

She gon' rock the V.V.S. stones
(If I let you go)
Cruise in the 'Bach or the Rolls
(If I let you go)
She gon' pocket everything I tote
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it, and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

He so done, workin' 'em both
She gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call--time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
(If I let you go)
Sit in the house off the coast
(If I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

She gon' rock the V.V.S. stones
(If I let you go)
Cruise in the 'Bach or the Rolls
(If I let you go)
She gon' pocket everything I tote
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show, and I won't let you go
All is been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
(If I let you go)
Sit in the house off the coast
(If I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go

I can't let you go
Damned if I let you goI live my life to the fullest 
Party every chance I get 
Friday nights, "The Spot" is the place I hit 
Decked out, chest out 
Me and my girls roll up in "The Spot" like we own the world 
You should see the eyes on me, dress fittin' like a prize on me 
High split , fellas get the rise on me 
Just from the looks of it , I must say 
You're bound to get hooked on it, if you play 

(Mekhi)

Your optomistic for someone goin to jail 

(Beyonce)

Would you stop bein' so damn stale 
I know you gotta girl but damn dont you wanna see new things 
Security shouldn't purchase a ring 

(Mekhi)

So why you lookin at me like that? 
Like what you say is true? 

(Beyonce)

I know your type I see through you 

(Mekhi)

Oh yea? What you see?? 
Cause I love my girl it's not about security I give her the world 
Shes down for and always has been 

(Beyonce)

And I would be, too, if I was your girlfriend 
But I'm not 
I even take you too "The Spot", bring sand to the beach, keep you on a leash, 
I know how thirsty these chicks could be 
Schemin and plottin on you, like me 

(Mekhi)

Listen, you a little too hot for a guy like me 
You and I are unlikely
My girl is more like me she just cool, you know? 
Not a risk-taker she just goes with the flow 

(Beyonce)

Shes wack You need a little spice in ya life 
Live a little you'll see what you want in a wife is in me 
I'm tellin you its like gold, 
Hard to let go, Harder to hold 
I'll dance with you slowly, too a hip-hop joint 
And only stop on a positive, you got the point? 

(Mekhi)

I dont dance, I dont drink I dont like clubs I'm not impressed 
I dont smoke, only scrubs go to different places and fall for pretty faces, 
To me, ya'll are all  basic 

(Beyonce)

And your life is wasted, 
Thats why you're a cop 
You never got to taste it if you had one drop, 
You wouldn't go back 
I'll prove it to you, 
Come out with me tonight, that'll do it for youAnd that's why they're beautiful....
And my heart used to be cold 'til your hands laid on my soul,
Baby, and that's why you're beautiful...

I'm not wondering why the sky's blue - that's not my business;
All I know is I look up and tell myself, "Be patient, love... that could be us..."

The lovers used to make love, not just to give us their piece of the beautiful...
Remember when we made love? Love... wasn't it beautiful?

Don't ask me why the sky's blue - that's not my business;
All I know is I look up and tell myself, "Be patient, love... that could be us..."

Diamonds used to be coal (be coal), look young 'cause they got soul (got soul),
And my heart used to be cold (be cold), 'til your hands laid on my soul... (my soul...)
Somebody's got to stay deep in love;
That could be us...
That's why we're beautiful...
That's why you're beautiful...

Ooh...
Oh, I... oh, I...

That's why we're beautiful...
That's why you're beautiful...
That's why you're beautiful...I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle yes indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day.

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfections
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
and that's exactly what I mean.

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love youBa-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-ba... ba-ba-ba... Bring the beat in!

Honey, honey, I can see the stars all the way from here;
Can't you see the glow on the windowpane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near;
Every time you touch me, I just melt away...

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear;
(People say "Love hurts,") but I know (it's gonna take a little work...) Whoa-oh!
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fightin' through my tears,
And finally, you put me first!

Baby, it's you! 
You're the one I love (one I love), you're the one I need! (I need...)
You're the only one I see!
Come on, baby, it's you! (It's you...)
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one I can always call! (Always call...)
When I need you, make everything stop - Finally, you put my love on top!
Ooh! Come on, baby! 
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top...
You put my love on top!
Ooh-ooh! Come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top, put my love on top, my love on top...

Baby, baby, I can hear the wind whipping past my face,
As we dance the night away...
And boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne, 
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again...

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear;
(People say "Love hurts,") but I know (that's it's gonna take a little work...) Oh-whoa, oh...
Nothin's perfect, but it's worth it after fightin' through my tears,
And finally, you put me first!

Baby, it's you! 
You're the one I love (one I love), you're the one I need! (I need...)

You're the one I love (one I love), you're the one I need! (I need...)
You're the only thing I see!
Come on, baby, it's you! (It's you...) 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one that always calls! (Always call...)
When I need you, baby, everything stops - Finally, you put my love on top!

You're the only one I see!
Come on, baby, it's you!

(mmm)

Ya lo ves, ya loves

Ya lo ves, amor, esta vez te olvidé
en el closet, en un rincón
están tus cosas, esto se acabó (se acabó)
Te juro que no te aguanto más
no te quiero ya, ni como amante
Esta vez no ganarás, te puedes marchar
y no vuelvas jamás

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
ya verás, que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate

¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
tu creías que eras imprescindible
pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte...
a olvidar tu amor

Ya me curé de dolor, ya te saqué de mi corazón
vete con ella, solos los dos
pobre de ti, lárgate, me das asco
Tu eres mi luz
pero hay amores que matan de daño
Me cansé de ti
ya no soy aquella infeliz

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
ya verás, que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate

¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
tu creías que eras imprescindible
pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte
voy a olvidar tu amor

Ya no soy nada para ti
alguien que no conoces
Lo nuestro se acabó
tanto daño al fin lo destruyó (destruyó)
Nunca lloraré por ti
porque ya me cansé de ti
No eres más imprescindible

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
te olvidé, te olvidé

(mmm)

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
ya lo ves, amor, esta vez te olvidé

Te olvidé, te olvidé

Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte...
voy a olvidar tu amor

¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
tu creías que eras imprescindible
pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte...

¿Qué sabes tu de mi? (baby) No me hagas reir
tu creías que eras imprescindible
pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme
(No hay más que hablar, terminamos)
¿Qué sabes tu de mi? (Este cuento al fin se he acabado) No me hagas reir
me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte...

I kill that thang woah, Manslaughter
You so sexy man I ain't flexin'
Shorty I'll drink your bath water
Ferragamo's are my loafers
Got my loafers on the sofa
And I'm drinkin' out the bottle
Man I'm gonna need a bib
Lookin' like a kid, tell you what it is
Tell you where to go, man I tell you what I did
You ain't kickin' it, you get kicked out

And your body must be anticipated
'Cause it already done leaked out

People think I'm crazy
But I love you 'cause you crazy tooNotice you the type that like to keep them on a leash though
I'm known to walk alone, but I'm alone for a reason
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me

Come harder; this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself; trust me, you need me
This ain't no shoulder with a chip or an ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

You need a real woman in your life (that's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (that's a good look)
And I'm-a help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look; ladies that's a good look)
Believe me, when you're in them big meetings for the mils (that's a good look)
You take me just to complement the deal (that's a good look)
And anything you cop, I split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look; ladies, that's a good look)
Believe me

[Chorus]
Partner, let me upgrade ya
Auda Marva Kade ya
Switch ya necktie to purple labels
Upgrade ya
I can up
Can I up
Let me up
Upgrade ya
Partner, let me upgrade ya
Partner, let me upgrade ya
Flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things and
Upgrade ya
I can up
Can I up
Let me up
Upgrade ya
Partner, let me upgrade ya

I can do for you what Martin did for the people
Ran by the man, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equal
Still play my part and let you take the lead role
Believe me

I'll follow; this could be easy
I'll be the help whenever you need me
I see your hustle; with my hustle I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

You need a real woman in your life (that's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (that's a good look)
I can help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look; ladies that's a good look)
Believe me, when you're in them big meetings for the mils (that's a good look)
You take me just to complement the deal (that's a good look)
Anything you cop, I split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look; ladies, that's a good look)
Believe me

[Chorus]

I be the b-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, Bubbles, Loraine Schwartz sorta dude
It's big ballin', baby, when I'm courtin' you
I'm talking spa bags and fly pads and rooms at the Bloomberg
And rumors you on the verge of a new marriage
'Cause that rock on your finger's like a tumor
You can't fit your hand in your new purse
It's humorous to me; they watchin' and we just yachtin'
Island hoppin' off the Omafi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn
No, not the car, but everywhere we are?
You sure to see stars
This is high-level, not eye-level
My bezzle courtesy of Auda Marv
I'll order yours tomorrow; now look at the time I saved ya
Mama, let me upgrade ya

Just when you think you had it all
Big ends, car notes, collectin' cars
Picture your life elevated with me
Make you my project celebrity
I'll keep your name hot in them streets

It's that little glimpse of light
That makes the diamond really shine
And you already is a star
But unless you're flawless
Then your dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

[Chorus]

Auda Marva Kay watch
Dimples in your neck tie
Hermez briefcase
Cartier top clips
Silk line blazers
Diamond cream facials
VVS cuff links
Six star pimp suites
Partner, let me upgrade ya, grade ya
Partner, partner, let me upgrade ya, grade ya
Let me, let me, let me upgrade ya, grade ya
Partner, partner, partner, let me upgrade yaI love to love you, baby

I'm feeling sexy
I want to hear you say my name, boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame

Feeling kind of horny
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just takin' over me
To start feelin' so crazy, babe
Lately I feel the funk comin' over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe

[Chorus]
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We're gon' turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
Tonight I'm calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

You're so sexy; tonight I am all yours, boy
The way your body moves across the floor, boy

Feeling kind of horny
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just takin' over me
To start feelin' so crazy, babe
Lately I feel the funk comin' over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe

[Chorus]

I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby

[Chorus: x2]But now everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied 
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

Just can't seem to get over 
The way you hurt me
I dont know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing 
The very thing you gave to me 
I thought I could forgive you and I know you've changed 
As much as I wanna trust you I know it ain't the same 
And it's all because you lied 

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this (Forget this)
But I'm much too full of resentment (I'm much too full of resentment)

I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can and 
I tried and I tried to forget this (Forget this)
I'm much too full of resentment

I'll always remember feeling (you lied) like I was no good (you lied)
Like I couldn't do it for you, like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied

Loved you more than ever (you lied)
More than my own life (you lied)
The best part of me I gave you (you lied)
It was sacrificed (Sacrificed)
And it's all because you lied 

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like (I can't go on and pretend)
I tried and I tried to forget this (I tried and I tried and I tried)
But I'm too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive but I was here first
I've been riding with you for six years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you
I know you probably thinking
"What's up with B?"
I've been crying for too long 
What did you do to me?

I use to be so strong
Now you took my soul
I'm crying, can't stop crying
Can't stop crying

You could've told me
You wasn't happy
I know you didn't want to hurt me 
But look what you've done to me now 

I gotta look at her in her eyes (you lied)
And see she's had half of me (you lied)
How could you lie? (How could you lie?)Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off the phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone

I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh, ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (you wanted)
Cause he's taken you for granted (for granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you'll wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything that you had got destroyed

But you're just a boyOut in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
But for the grace of God go I

I found heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

I've been alone
When I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home
Knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down

You are my heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria

Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hit you and then you realize
It's out of your hands
Baby, you got to understand

You are my heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave MariaWhen I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

I didn't want no man
I didn't wanna fall in love, and
I didn't care about your girl
I didn't care how we would end up

But that was then, this is now
I think I'm experiencing love
I don't wanna wreck up your home
That's why I'm convinced, I gotta go

[Chorus]

Everytime she calls, you expect
Me to disappear like we never met
At first I didn't mind, but now I
Sometimes feel like you're all mine

You told me it was all about me, me
It's not about me if your still with her
Now I've realized that I've gotta move on
It might be hard, but I,
I gotta move on

[Chorus]

I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)
I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)
[Repeat to fade]You better sit down and look around
Cause you must've bumped yo' head
And I love you enough to talk some
sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home, me the kids
And the dog is gone
Check my credentials...
I give you everything you want
everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why?

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

I got beauty, I got class
I got style, and I got ass
And you don't even care to care Looka here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
Now, now now now now now now
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune Ooh.....

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

There's nothing not to love about me
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me I'm lovely
There's nothing not to need about me
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just plain....... DUMBFever

There was a time
I thought that you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been outta my mind

So when I think of the time that I
Almost loved you
You showed your ass and I
I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged a bullet
I'm so over you
So baby, good luck getting out

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with it
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
You turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)
And I'm gon' always be the
(Best thing you've never had)
Oh, yeah
I bet it sucks to be you right now

So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there
When I think that there was a time
That I almost loved you
You showed your ass
And baby, yes, I saw the real you

Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged a bullet
I'm so over you
Baby, good luck getting out

I wanted you bad
I'm so through with it
'Cause honestly you turned out to be the
(Best thing I never had)

When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets,
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know - I was here....

I want to say I lived each day until I die,
And know that I meant something in somebody's life...
The hearts that I touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know - I was here....

I just want them to know that I gave my all, did my best, brought someone some happiness,
Left this world a little better, just because I was here...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I want to leave my mark so everyone will know...

I was here;
(I lived,) I lived... (I loved...) 
I was here...
(I did,) I did! (I've done...) 
I was here!
(I lived,) I lived... (I loved) I loved!
I was here... (Oh, ooh, ooh...)
I did, I've done...
I was here.To deserve even one Of the Pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, What did I ever do
That was worth loving you Or the Kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me Jesus, My Soul's in your Hand.

Try me Lord, If you think there's a Way
I can try to repay All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself On my Way back to you.

Yes Lord, help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me Jesus, My Soul's in your Hand.

[Chorus]
What's it gonna be, boy?
I'm watching you, you watching me

Can't you feel this chemistry?
What's it gonna be, boy?
It's so damn crowded we should leave
What's it gonna be, boy?
Tell me, what's it gonna be?

Can we take it there?
Club's about to close; give me one more dance, then I'm ready to go
When the deejay's playing all the same songs, then the night's about to end
Can we meet in the parking lot, find a quiet place where we can talk
To find out more about each other, baby, can we?

Ooo, I wanna get closer
Ooo, baby, let me show ya
Ooo, I'm glad you came over and made your move; now tell me what you wanna do
Ooo, tell me what I wanna hear

What's it gonna be, boy?
This place is crowded; we should leave
What's it gonna be, boy?
Tell me, what's it gonna be?


You know I'm feeling you (I'm feeling you)
Tonight's on; let's find a spot (you feeling me)
To go so we can get to know each other better

If you go and tell your boys (Go tell your boys)
We gon' be leaving; tell me, what's it gonna be?
You know I'm feeling you (I'm feeling you)

What's it gonna be, boy?
Tell me, what's it gonna be?
What's it gonna be, boy?
What's it gonna be, boy?
What's it gonna be, boy?[Verse 1]
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

[Chorus]
Me, Myself and I that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And there ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I will be my own best friend

[Repeat Chorus]

So controlling to say that you love me but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over stop calling me come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like your still with me all your homies know
Even your very best friend try to warn me on the low
Took me some time but now I am strong
Because I realized I got

[Chorus]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
Got me, myself and I
(I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Yeah you hurt me but I learned alot along the way)
So I have vowed to make it through
(After all the rain you'll see the sun come out again)

[Repeat Chorus]

Oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh)
Oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh) woo woo (woo woo)

Yeah

[Bridge]
Now I've got me, myself and I (I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(If ya cried a thousand times ladies you will survive)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Yeah, ya hurt me but I learned a lot along the way)
So I have vowed to make it through (After all the rain you'll see the sun come again)I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at
Just one shot left of this drink
In this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise
And I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling
That's because I'm jealous

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this

Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
Beyoncé fillin' out this skirt
I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy, you'll been hanging out alright tonight
I'm staying out till tomorrow
Been dancing on them tables
Ain't got no cares, no sorrows
I ran into my ex
Said what up to his bestest
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas
Don't be jealous

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh you're jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh you're jealous

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this no, no, no

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealousShow you how much I appreciate you
Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true

Wanna show you how much you got your girl feelin' good
Wanna show you how much, how much you're understood
Wanna show you how much, I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me bay

Wanna show you how much, I really care about yo' heart
I wanna show ya how much, I hate being apart
Show ya, show ya, show ya til you're through with me
I wanna keep it how it is, so you can never say how it used to be

(Bridge)
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

(Chorus)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody 'cuz

You'll never need two, 'cuz I will be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you

'Cuz I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backin' this thing back
Pop-poppin' this thing back
Drop-drop-drop-dropping this thing back

This is for the time, you gave me flowers
For the world, that is ours
For the mulah, for the power of love
I know I won't never ever eh-ever give you up

And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and the freak in the you know what
Sit back sit back it's the pre game show
Daddy you know what's up

(Bridge)
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

(Chorus)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body

Baby lemme put my body on your body
Promise not to tell nobody 'cuz
It's 'bout to go down

Imma take this time
To show you how much you mean to me
'Cuz you all I need
No money can emphasize or describe
The love that's in between the lines
Boy look into my eyes

While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel

Rockin' on you babe
Rockin' rockin' on you babe
Swirlin' on you babe
In my mind all I can think about
Is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past
And a chance to make this love last

(Chorus)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body

Ground, another ground-breakin day in the club
Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut
Reminesin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in
No watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems
Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies
On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong
Had to get our shit together and move it along
Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas
Drivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm

Wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

Was interuppted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit
Back in the days when I was movin much shit, "What up chick?"
Maintanin, it's the same old thang
A little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed
I see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she nodded her head in agreement
Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down
While the Streets is Watchin, stay hooded down
Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now?
She said "Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye"
I was too deep for you from day one
Thats why we never had relations, continued in my own zone

I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done

Uh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks
Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark
Wanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample
Dangerous games we played on the third rail
Fiend for the summer breeze
Hopped out the Lee's Dungrares
into the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports
to take us away from here, but I cut too much
So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush
My sinners used to back me up
Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me
All my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll
Let's reach for the stars now... Jigga!

I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever doneSlowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg
A-town's up, deuces down it's the new call
And you can dial 1-888-CUT-SOMETHING
I'm your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something
Ain't no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I'm a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian but under the sheets
It's the player from the Point
And your girl from the D

Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers
The girls all pause, got them drippin down they sugar walls
Aw naw! Getting to the nappy root 
Knocking boots and stilettos, damn I keep it ghetto!
A cool type of fellow, mellow got the gold medal
Never settle for less my rose petal
Tooey, tooey, tooey, tooey! Spit game!
Venom to get it up in 'em, let me 'p' pop that thang
First check her brain to see if she's sane,
Deranged or strange or crazy as hell

Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins man!Not even pinchin' myself I don't care, I'm with you, you're with me

And I don't have a reason to be, if I can't be with you

No, I don't need hands if I don't get to keep you warm
And I don't really need myself, if I don't need you

I open my eyes so I could see with you
And I live so I can die with you

And I don't really need these fingers,
if I don't get to touch your spine

if I ain't walking by your side

To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

Oh-oh-ohYou know I got my top back and my beat low, rockin’ my stunna shades and turnin’ up my radio...
Turn up my radio...

I think I'm in love with my radio, 'cause it never lets me down;
And I fall in love with my stereo whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,)
Whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...)
Whenever I hear that sound...

You're the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room;
With the door closed, we'd be alone...
And Mama never freaked out when she heard it go boom,
'Cause she knew we were in the zone...

Hold him in my arms, and look out of my window (under the moonlight),
And he'd be keeping me calm, so I never let him go;
He's got a place in my heart...

I think I'm in love with my radio, 'cause it never lets me down;
And I fall in love with my stereo (with my stereo-o-o...) whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...

When I get into my car, I turn it uh-uh, uh-up,
Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-uh, uh-unk,
And the bassline be rattling through my se-ee, ee-ats,
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing, ee-ing, oh...
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ (playing the stuff I like)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays;
He’s got a place in my heart...

I think I’m in love with my radio, 'cause it never lets me down;
And I fall in love with my stereo whenever I hear that sound....
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...

I be on the hotline like erryday, makin’ sure the DJ know what I want him to play;
You know I got my top back and my beat low, rockin’ my stunna shades and turnin’ up my radio...
Turn up my radio...

I think I’m in love with my radio, 'cause it never lets me down;
And I fall in love with my stereo whenever I hear that sound....
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...

Oh-whoa-whoa...
Oh-whoa-whoa...
Oh-whoa-whoa, oh...You can have the love you need to live...
But if you look for truthfulness, you might just as well be blind -
It always seems to be so hard to give...

Honesty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard,
And mostly what I need from you...

I can always find someone to say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve...
But I don't want some pretty face to tell me pretty lies;
All I want is someone to believe...

Honesty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard,
And mostly what I need from you...

I can find a lover, I can find a friend;
I can have security until the bitter end...
Anyone can comfort me with promises again, I know...

When I'm deep inside of me, don't be too concerned;
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone...
But when I want sincerity, tell me, where else can I turn,
When you're the one that I depend upon?

-esty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard;
Mostly what I need from you...I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love
I love you Houston

And I've been drifting off of knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks
Man these women getting solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wander
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge
I preach my gut it can't help ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cuz all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring
All these record labels boring
I don’t trust these record labels, I’m touring
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
How come?

What goes up
Ghost around

What goes up
Ghost around
Ghost around...

Soul not for sale
Prob’ly won’t make no money off this
Oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so... Umh

It’s what you do
It’s what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

You want me?
I walk down the hallway
You lucky?
The bedroom's the wrong way
Slap me, I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm on to you
You must be on to me

It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you

You must be onto me
(Onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me
(Onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me
(Onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me
(Onto you, I'm onto you)

Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)"Miss Third Ward, your first question. What is your aspiration in life?"
: "Hoh... my aspiration in life? Would be... to be happy."

Mama said, "You're a pretty girl;
What's in your head, it doesn't matter...
Brush your hair, fix your teeth;
What you wear is all that matters..."

Just another stage, pageant the pain away;
This time, I'm gonna take the crown without falling down, down, down...

Pretty hurts;
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
Perfection is a disease of a nation;
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...

Pretty hurts;
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see;
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

Blonder hair, flat chest;
TV says, "Bigger is better..."
South Beach, sugar-free;
Vogue says, "Thinner is better...."

Just another stage, pageant the pain away;
This time, I'm gonna take the crown without falling down, down, down...

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
Perfection is a disease of a nation;
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts... (Pretty hurts...)

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see;
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away;
The pain's inside, and nobody frees you from your body...
It's my soul, it's my soul that needs surgery;
It's my soul that needs surgery...

Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far,
Then you break when the fake facade leaves you in the dark
You're left with shattered mirrors, and the shards of a beautiful girl...

Pretty hurts; (Oh, oh...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst... (Pretty hurts...)
Perfection is a disease of a nation; (Pretty hurts...)
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst... (Oh! Oh, oh...)
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see; (Pretty hurts...)
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

When you're alone all by yourself, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
and you're lying in your bed, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Reflection stares right into you; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
You stripped away the masquerade, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
The illusion has been shed; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)

Yes...You didn't know I was a risk, and it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you, but all I made you was lonely...

I couldn't see, but now I know that I acted selfishly;
I should've known that I'd let you down and cause you so much misery...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...

I should've been there...
I should've been there...
I should've been there...
I should've been there...

All of the times you used to cry because I would let you down;
I'm losin' time! I should've tried a little more to be around...
But I didn't know that you were hurting, I was just too blind;
Only thing I know for certain: another you, I'll never find...

I couldn't see, but now I know that I acted selfishly;
I should've known that I'd let you down and cause you so much misery...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...

I should've been there...
I should've been there...
I should've been there...
I should've been there...

I'm filled with regret - I'm gonna tip and soak myself in misery;
Now in your life, I'll take more time - No more yearning without me...
But, it hurts to think of you all by yourself, but now I see,
And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me...

I couldn't see, but now I know that I acted selfishly;
I should've known that I'd let you down and cause you so much misery...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...

I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there...

I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there...Ya lo ves, ya lo ves, ya lo ves amor esta vez, te olvide!
En el closet, en un rincon estan tus cosas, esto se acabo!

Te juro que ya no te aguanto más,
no te quiero ya ni como amante

y no vuelvas jamas
Y si acaso piensas,
que esta vez voy a perdonar,
ya verás que nunca más
me vuelves a engañar,
ya largate!

que sabes tu de mi no me hagas reir,
tu creías que eras imprecindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
que sabes tu de mi no me hagas reir,
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte,a olvidar tu amor

Ya me cure del dolor,
ya te saqué de mi corazón
Vete con ella solos los dos
Pobre de ti, largate me das asco
Tu eres mi luz, Pero hay amores
que matan de daño
me canse de ti,
ya no soy aquella infeliz

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez
voy a perdonar, ya verás
Que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya largate

que sabes tu de mi, no me hagas reir,

Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme,baby
que sabes tu de mi no me hagas reir,
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte,
voy a olvidar tu amor

alguien que no conoces
Lo nuestro se acabó
tanto daño al fin lo destruyó
Nunca lloraré por ti
Porque ya me cansé de ti
No eres mas inprescindible

ya lo ves ya lo ves,
te olvidé, te olvidé
ya lo ves ya lo ves,
ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
Te olvidé, te olvidé

voy a olvidar tu amor!No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Oye (mm-hmm) como llora mi canción
Preciso tu atención debes oír
Hoy no se quien soy ni se adonde voy
Encontrarme hoy es mi missión
De tu prisón por fin ya soy libre

Oye
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Hoy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Que nada en valor voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz

Nunca quisiste que me fuera a volar
Hallar mi identidad, que gran error
Hoy grito no tengo más temor
Hoy tu alumna te dice adiós
De tu prisón por fin ya soy libre

Oye
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Hoy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz

Yo soy tu gran criación
Por eso es que me voy
Dime adiós, dime adiós

Oye, lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Ya me voy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor hoy ya lo decidí
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz
mi voz.Body shining lightin' up the place
And when you talk, everybody stop
'Cause I know you know just what you sayin'

The way that you protect your friends
Baby I respect you for that
And when you grow you'll take everyone you love along
I love that shit

You shelter my soul, you're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know

Baby when you stole my cool
'Cause you had me at hello

Baby while I'm on my grind

Come between me and my family time and

You keep me humble, I like this type
'Cause you know there's more to life
And if I need ya, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul, you're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know

You don't have to try so hard for me to love you
Boy without you my life just ain't the same
You don't have to try so hard for me to love you

Sometimes I shake my head,
when I'm layin' down in my bed.
Thinkin' 'bout the things been said,
when you really don't know me yet.

Gotta clear up some things
there have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved.
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya,
give it a rest.
You must admire me,
spend so much time with me consuming your head.

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out.
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies.
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh

It's really been weighing on me,
i'm not myself lately.
I feel a little incomplete,
but i'm not gonna lose no sleep.
I keep it all in my mind,
cause it gotta get better in time.
Why don't you live your life?
And let me live mine.

Leave me alone, leave me alone, just leave me alone, leave me alone ...Tell the storm I'm new
I'm a wall, come and march on the regular
Painting white flags blue

Lord forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'mma rain, I'mma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose
Singin', "Freedom, freedom, where are you?"
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

I'mma wade, I'mma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof

Lord forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose
Singin', "Freedom, freedom, where are you?"
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose
Singin', "Freedom, freedom, where are you?"
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

And life is like a song

Oh yeah yeah
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream, that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Miente, lo ves
Es un juego
(Yo conosco cosas del que tu no quieres ni saber)
Sabe decir lo que
Quieres oir
Un bello embustero
(Solo por placer nuestra amistad no vamos a perder)

A mi tambien
Siempre quiere verme sola
No hay que caer
En su trampa una vez mas

Ay, no nos pelearemos
Ay, no nos va a engañar
Ay, no terminaremos
Por un bello embustero

No, nos va dividir?
No, no nos va a exitar
No, vamos a sufrir?
Por un bello embustero

Confiaba en el
Mas cuando lo que encontre
Besandote el cuello
(Pero el no lo podia creer las dos caimos en su red)
Por que a ti?
Si hay mil por ahi
El es un perro
(Las dos sin querer caimos presas en su piel)

A mi tambien
Siempre quiere verme sola
No hay que caer
En su trampa una vez mas

Ay, no nos pelearemos
Ay, no nos va a engañar
Ay, no terminaremos
Por un bello embustero

No, nos va dividir?
No, no nos va a exitar
No, vamos a sufrir?
Por un bello embustero

Lo creia tan mio
Yo vivia por el
Fuimos un desafio
Que pudo mas que el
Es un hombre muy frio
No es de una mujer

El no nos va separarIf I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll oudda bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it.
Cause they'd stick up for me.

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man.
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a girl
Even just for a day
I'd get oudda bed in the mornin'
And take forever to ready.
Complain to my friends
As if they got a man. (Ohh)
They talk about you cause they jealous,
I just steady listen to it
I should get rid of them.

If I were a girl
I don't think I'd understand
How it feels to love a boy
I swear I'd be a better woman.
I'd listen to him
Cause I don't know everything.
I would always try to tell em
That he needs to treat me better
Like I don't godda change at all.
If I were a girl

It's a little too late for you to come back (No)
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that (I don't)
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong (I'm better off)

But you're just a boy
And you're just a girl
You don't understand (No)
Yeah you don't understand (Oh)
How it feels to love a girl someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
And you don't listen to him
You don't care how it hurts
You don't care how I feel
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
But you're just a boy
And you're just a girlI was spending all my nights and days laid back daydreaming
Look at me, I'm a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town, now, bitches, I run this... Ah!

'Cause I put it (down like that, put down like that)
And I'm makin' (all these racks, all these racks)
And I'm movin' (round like that, round like that)
When I do it, (I don't look back, don't look back)

I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want (But of course!)
I can be bad if I want, I can do wrong if I want
I can live fast if I want, I can go slow all night long
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want

They love the way I walk, 'cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk, 'cause I ain't pretending
It took a while, now I understand just where I'm goin'
I know the world and I know who I am, it's 'bout time I show it... Ah!

'Cause I put it (down like that, put down like that)
And I'm makin' (all these racks, all these racks)
And I'm movin' (round like that, round like that)
When I do it, (I don't look back, don't look back)

I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want (But of course!)
I can be bad if I want, I can say what I want
I can live fast if I want, I can go slow all night long
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want

I'm a grown woman (I'm grown)
And I know that I got it (Got it, got it)
I'm a grown woman (I'm grown)
Ain't got no room in my pockets (Ah)

You really wanna know how I got it like that?
'Cause I got a cute face and my booty so fat

Go girl! (Go, girl) She got that bomb, that bomb

Learn to be lonely 
Learn to find your way in darkness 

Who will be there for you 
Comfort and care for you 
Learn to be lonely 
Learn to be your one companion

Learn to love life that is lived alone

But when you're holding me tight, I feel alive...

Each day, I feel so blessed to be looking at you,
'Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive...
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name,

Came into this world
Daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me
Oh, oh, oh
Daddy made me dance
And daddy held my hand
Oh, oh, oh
And daddy liked his whisky with his tea
And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be

He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
Oh, and that's when he gave to me

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh

Daddy made me fight
It wasn't always right
But he said girl it's your second amendment, oh, oh, oh
He always played it cool
But daddy was no fool
And right before he died he said remember

He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
And that's when daddy looked at me

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

My daddy warned me about men like you
He said baby girl he's playing you
He's playing you
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said baby girl he's playing you
He's playing you
'Cause when trouble comes in town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
'Cause when trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot

Welcome to HollywoodYou feel good feeling low
I like my colours vivid
And you paint your colors gone
I like to see the world and you like your week in tone
But I've been taining behind while you refused to go

'Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight above my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes
I like trips to the movies you watch TV all night long
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang
And I've been right beside you losing me and doing the same

'Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight above my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

I looked around and baby you were gone
Where did I lost you honey
I even slow down thought you'd fall low
But you took your own roads honey
'Cause I've been traveling traveling traveling
No lead to find you
I'm making this trip alone
And I've been staying behind while you refused to go

'Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight above my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" signI'm still in love
I never met love quite before
Until I saw your face
And watching stars without you
My soul cries
My heaving heart
Is full of pain
When we're apart
the aching
I'm kissing you

See me up in the club with fifty eleven girls;
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill...
Brooklyn brim, with my eyes sittin' low,
And every boy in here with me got that smoke,
And every girl in here gotta look me up and down;
All on Instagram, cake by the pound...
Circulate the image every time I come around;
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin', babe...

Brought this all for you, just walk my way...
(Just tell me how it's looking, babe, just tell how it's looking, babe...)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim...
(And tell me how it's looking, babe...) How it's lookin', babe... (Tell me how it's lookin', babe, lookin' babe...)

Drop the bass - man, the bass get lower;
Radio say speed it up, I just go slower...
High like treble, puffin' on the mids;
No man ain't never seen a booty like this...
And why you think you keep my name rollin' up the tongue?
'Cause when you wanna smash, I just write another one...
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker;
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...

Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor...

"Beyoncé, Beyoncé?"
"Are you happy to be in Paris? Are you happy to be in Paris?"
"Beyoncé, Beyoncé? Beyoncé!"



Driver, roll up the partition, please...

Driver, roll up the partition, please;
I don't need you seeing Yoncé on her knees...
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up;
We ain't even gon' make it to this club...
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged;
Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck...
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse;
He Monica Lewinskied all on my gown...

Whoa there, daddy, daddy, didn't bring the towel;
Whoa baby, baby, we better slow it down...
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up,
And we ain't even gon' make it to this club...

Take all of me;
I just wanna be the girl you like... (Girl you like...) The kinda girl you like is right here with me...

Driver, roll up the partition fast...

Driver, roll up the partition fast;
Over there, I swear I saw them cameras flash...
Handprints and footprints on my glass,
Handprints and good grips all on my ass...
Private show, with the music blasting;
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty...
Red wine drip, filth, talk that trash;
Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash...

Whoa there, daddy, daddy, now you ripped my fur;
Whoa baby, baby, be sweatin' out my hair...
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up,
And we ain't even gon' make it to this club...

Take all of me;

Take all of me;

You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation
In connection to the sun
With you next to me
There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrop
I am the sea
With you and God, who's my sunlight
I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud
So proud to be your girl
You make the confusion
Go all away
From this cold and messed up world

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
Cause years before I became who I am
Baby you were my man
I know it ain't easy
Easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication
From you to me
Later on in my destiny
I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife
And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you
sometimes make me wanna cry
Realize all my blessings
I'm grateful
To have you by my side

Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world
To love and to hold
To feel
To breathe
To love you

Dangerously in love
Can't do this thing
I love you , I love you, I love you
I'll never leave
Just keep on loving me
I'm in love with you
I can not do
I cannot do anything without you in my life
Holding me, kissing me, loving me

Dangreously in loveOh... (Virgo...)

I wish I could look in your eyes, and tell you how I feel right now, inside;
Baby, I know that it's real (real), so real (real), so real (real), so real...

Mmm... (Miss you...)
How I wish I could be with you...
(I miss you...)
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now...

Every morning, every afternoon, every night, I wanna be with you;
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play, stay in a hotel room all day,
I just wanna be with you...
I love everything about you, from your old-school tennis shoes, 
to the way you move when you're dancing with me...

Do you remember our first kiss? It wasn't long enough...
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together? They were not long enough...
All of our conversations, all of your sweet pages, they're never long enough...

When it's time for me to leave, it's so hard to say good-bye;
I never want to say good-bye... I never ever want to say good-bye...

One day, we'll make love;
Finally, I'll be yours...
Only you, only you - I could love you...
But it's too late: I already love you...
I love you (I love you), I love you (I love you), I love you... (I love you...)That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different
From when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror
After all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

Super power
A subtle power
Super power
A tough love
Super power
Like a shark
Super power
Like a bear
A tough love

And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down

And just like you I can't be scared
And just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there
Tough love
Super power
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls
It's a super power
Super power
The laws of the world never stopped us once
Cause together we got plenty super power

Super power
A subtle power
Super power
A tough love
Super power
Like a shark
Super power
Like a bear
A tough love

And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down

Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us downBody bangin' up corset
Brothas wanna toss it
But they lost, cause my game made them forfeit
Slicker than a porpis and thicker than a horses
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I'll stick to my thesis, I'll stick to my features
Brothas trying to hold, but thier game never reaches
Most of these cats are like the middle of peaches

I see you looking at, but what you looking at?
You in a bar, wanna twist me like a bottle cap

Mos Def  - I'm trying to holla Miss, to see if you gonna holla back

Beyonce' - Your game is whack, and know you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunkin that

Mos Def  - But this is Miller, Lieutenant, if you're wondering

Sarpong  - And I'm the thag

Mos Def  - Mel Gibson

Sarpong  - Danny Gloverin'

Beyonce' - But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumbling
See, I have dreams with a man, what will become of him?
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should post pone my goals, he got tricks up his sleeve?
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down

Mos Def  - I got a warrant for ya heart and a bedroom and trial

Sarpong  - Get a pardon if you come with the Sergeant, now

Beyonce' - Give me a chair, cause I don't care, I ain't feeling your style

Chorus

Mos Def  - Yo, I'm trying to get with you shorty

Beyonce' - But I'm not feeling you

Sarpong  - But I'm an officer shorty

Beyonce' - My looks are killing you


Mos Def  - Murder One will get you under the covers

Beyonce' - Game taller, man slaughter, I ain't feeling you brothas

Mos Def  - Yo, I'm trying to get with you shorty

Beyonce' - But I'm not feeling you

Sarpong  - But I'm an officer shorty

Beyonce' - My looks are killing you

Mos Def  - Murder One will get you under the covers

Beyonce' - Game taller, man slaughter, I ain't feeling you brothas

Eyes like the ocean

Mos Def  - Ma, I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise 'em high and daddy long stroke you

Beyonce' - Hair like forever

Sarpong  - Swear I could do it better
Take my gun out the holster, I still got the Barretta

Beyonce' - Brothas sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing, but that kid...

Mos Def  - Don't waste your time, he ain't no doing, he's just a Sergeant
Passing out tickets for parking

Sarpong  - Chickenheads clucking

Beyonce' - Pitiful bulls barking

See this is Carmen, voice sweet as marvin
I turn out lights, with the switch, when I'm walking
Girls getting jealous, cause they man always hawking
Even got Lou looking at me like he stalking
And I got a mind too
I wouldn't bless you, 
if your first name was "Hachu" on Sunday singing gospel

Mos Def  - You ain't a dime, just a nickel acting hostel

Beyonce' - I'm headed for the big time , I'm bouncing on this side-show...Yo, we grew up together, we cut school together
When we have kids, go through terrible two's together

Reagan:
And when they turn three we'll be watchin' the news together
Cop found slain that kind of pain last forever

Mekhi:
So what you me to be, huh?

Reagan:
A man of your family

Mekhi:
What?  Soccer dad, Saturdays, load up the Camry?

Reagan:
If I ever lost you the next would be my sanity
A house without you is not a home
It's more like Amityville

Mekhi:
Come on, Caela, you need to play fair, like vanity
You're the only woman that I speak with so candidly
You're the only woman I've been with, how can it be?
theres other fish inside the sea, but none can swim beside you, see
But becomin' a cop is like becomin a man to me

Reagan:
And if you get shot then you'll become a body bag, you see
I love more than slaves love the thought of bein' free

Mekhi:
What, you and me?

Reagan:
Simpson

Mekhi:
Ashford

Both:
Eternally

Reagan:
What about a desk job 
You still protect and servin' me
'Cause I don't wanna get that call from the infirmary
Thoughts of your surgery constantly disturbin' me

Mekhi:
But possibly a captian, your pessimism's concernin' me
You know I love you I don't have to say it verbally
wouldn't leave you in Berlin in post-war Germany

Reagn:
Somethin' just occured to me

Mekhi:
Listen, only emergencyis me and you inside the bedroom

Lock opened, doorknob turned

Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words
You've got me!

You've got me
You've got me
You've got me
You've got me speechless

Laying so closely
I feel your skin rubbing and touching me
Only sweat between us
Feeling you kissing and pleasing me

I kiss your neck
I know that you love when we touch like that
I can feel you need me
Feels so good to me
Feels so good to me

Going outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night

All I can say is
Yes, yes, yes, yes

Kiss me
Hold me
You've got me
SpeechlessYou're my James Dean - You make me feel like I'm seventeen...
You drive too fast, you smoke too much,
But that don't mean a thing, 'cause I'm addicted to the rush...

('Cause I rather die young than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...
'Cause I rather die young (than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...

You know, I've been in love before;
You're the first one I ever seen that burns like gasoline...
So light a match, turn off the lights;
I'm holdin' on to you, 'cause this might be our last night, oh...

('Cause I rather die young than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...
'Cause I rather die young (than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...

What I'm tellin' you: I'm givin' you my life, it's in your hands,
And what I'm gonna do is be a woman, and you can be a man,
And I wanna say nobody understands what we been through;
I rather give up everything than to live my, live my life without you...

All!
All!

('Cause I rather die young than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...
'Cause I rather die young (than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...Now I'm crying and deserted, baby, but you don't care...
Can't nobody tell me this is love, when you're immune to all my pain;
I need you to tell me this is love - You don't care, well, that's okay...

Well, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la, la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...)
Oh, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la, la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...) Aow!

Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry, 
And now, every time our love goes sour, you won't sympathize...
You see these tears fallin' down to my ears - I swear, you like when I'm in pain, yeah;
I try to tell you all my fears, huh! You still don't care - that's okay...

Hey... well, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la-la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...)
Oh, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care... Yeah...
(La-la-la, la-la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...) Aow!

Boy, maybe if you cared enough, I wouldn't have to care so much...
What happened to our trust? Now you're just givin' up;
You used to be so in love - now you don't care no more!

Well, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la,la...) Baby! (La-la-la, la-la la...)
Oh, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la...) Baby! (La-la-la, la-la-la...) I still care!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...) I still care!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...) I still care!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...) Aow!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...) I still care!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...)Even though
Did me wrong
I always stayed
By your side
I guess
I was your fool
I always cared
There's no one
Above you
I swear
Cheated on me now
She's there

She won't answer
Your calls
Don't wanna be
Bothered at all
I guess
I'll be the one
Standing
With open arms
Sucka for love
Kisses too
Ya touch
I'm crazy for you

(Chorus:)
I'll settle for you
Yes
I will be
The one who will
Settle for you
Yes
I will be
The one you run to
You come running to
Yes
I will be
The one who will
Settle for you
Settle for you

I can never
Leave you
No matter how
Hard I try
You'll probably
Do it again
I'll still be
Right here waiting
Nothing has changed
It remains
The same
I can't explain

Sucka for love
Ya kisses too
Ya touch
I'm crazy for you

(Chorus)

Even
When the chips
Are down
I'll still
Settle for you
You'll probably
Hurt me again
I'll still
Settle for you
I know I must be
The world's
Greatest fool

I'll still
Settle for you

(Chorus)

I will always
Love you
No matter how
Hard I try
Probably
Do it again
I'll still be
Here waiting
Stuck with you
In love with you
Here for you
Loving you
Settling for you

Now pass me my dress. (Yes!)

I think I'm ready - Been locked up in the house way too long;
It's time to get it, 'cause once again, he's out doing wrong...
And my girls are so real, said it's been a minute since I had some;
He's been acting up, but he won't be the only one...

(Oh...) Cause when they act wrong (Oh...), that's when you put it on;
(Oh, oh...) Get 'em uptight - this is your song...

(Oh...) So roll out the big gun, (Oh...) and put your freakum dress on...

Soon as he saw me, turned on by how the dress was fitting right;
Short and backless (backless, backless...), seein' my silhouette in the moonlight...
Such an attraction, keep telling me how my outfit's so nice;
Little did he know - ha! - my man gon' take it off tonight...

(Oh...) Cause when they act wrong (Oh...), that's when you put it on;
(Oh, oh...) Get 'em uptight - this is your song...

(Oh...) Every woman got one... (Oh...) Shut it down when the time comes;
(Oh...) So roll out the big gun, (Oh...) and put your freakum dress on...

All the ladies, you ain't get all dressed up in your dresses,
and your best digs for no reason - Get ready to freakum, freakum!

When you put it on, it's an invitation;
When they play your song, get on up and shake it! (Yeah...)
Pokin' out your back - you don't have to waste it,
Spin it all around, then take it to the ground, and...

I got my freakum dress on. I got my freakum dress on. (Oh...)(Hey.)
(Hey.)

-------------------------------------------------------------

[Hook: Beyonce]-You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

I didn't want no man
I didn't wanna fall in love, and
I didn't care about your girl
I didn't care how we would end up

But that was then, this is now
I think I'm experiencing love
I don't wanna wreck up your home
That's why I'm convinced, I gotta go

When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

Everytime she calls, you expect
Me to disappear like we never met
At first I didn't mind, but now I
Sometimes feel like you're all mine

You told me it was all about me, me
It's not about me if your still with her
Now I've realized that I've gotta move on
It might be hard, but I,
I gotta move on

When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)
I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secret, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this?
Going through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, and know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Oh it is such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's upOooh Oooh 
On A star 

And I'm wishing on a star 
To follow where you are 
I'm wishing on a dream 
To follow what it means 
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see 
I wish on all the people who really dream 
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes. 
And I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done 
I never thought I'd see a time when you would be 
So far away from home 
So far away from me 
Just think of all the moments that we can spend 
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant 
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know, 
In the game of love, you reap what you sow 

I feel it's time we should make up baby 
I feel it's time for us to get together 
And make the best of things, oh baby 
When we're together 
Whether or never 
I feel it's time we should make up baby 
I feel it's time for us to get together 
And make the best of things, oh baby. 
When we're together. 
(Let's get together, baby) 
Whether or never. 

And I'm wishin on a star 
To follow where you are 
And I'm wishing on a dreamLet me take this off, while you watch me - Yes, mass appeal...
Don't take your eyes, don't take your eyes off it;
Watch it, babe...
If you like, you can touch it, baby;
(Do you?) You know you wanna touch it, baby...
Ooh... Grab ahold, don't let go, let me know that you ready;
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around...
(You rock hard, I rock steady.)

And rock right up to the side of my mountain,
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak...
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain;
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep...
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow;
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe...
And wash me over until my well runs dry;
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me...

Rocket/rock it 'til waterfalls/water falls....
Rocket 'til waterfalls...
Rock it 'til water falls...
Bathe in these waterfalls

I do it like it's my profession - I gotta make a confession:
I'm proud of all this bass - baby, I'll put it in your face...
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist,
I can be your piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer;
Anything else that you may read between the lines, you and I create...
Rockets and waterfalls...

So rock right up to the side of my mountain,
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak...
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain;
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep...
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow;
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe...
And wash me over until my well runs dry;
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me...

Hard... rock. Steady... rock. Hard... rock. Steady... rock.
Hard... rock. Steady... rock. Hard... rock. Steady...

Don't you know that I give you your loving if you need it?
I give you my word, you can believe it...
Your love feels like all four seasons 
Growing inside me - Life has a reason...
Swimming in my love, your love lifting,
Higher, harder, got me screaming to the lord, boy...
Kiss me - Pray we don't overflow, baby, I know you can feel it pulse,
Deep in the peak of my waterfall...
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, 'til the water falls... (Rockets and waterfalls...)

Damn.

I can't help but love the way we make love...

Daddy... Daddy... ooh, child. Ooh, now. 
Yes, Lord. Damn, baby.... You're driving me cray-cray...

You ain't right for doing it to me like that, Daddy,
Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl...
Tell me, what you're gon' do about that?
(Punish me, please... Punish me, please...)
Daddy, what you gon' with all of this ass, all up in your face?
Yeah, hell yeah... (Love me so deep...)
Ooh, my shit's so good, it ain't even right... I know I'm right;
Hell yeah, you the shit - that's why you're my equivalent...
So sexy...

We're so much more than pointless fixtures, Instagram pictures,
Consumers... (What about that ching-ching-ching? What about that, what about that ching-ching?)
Baby boomers... (Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...)
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in...
Home is where the heart is;
Goddammit, I'm comfortable in my skin,
And you're comfortable in my skin...
You look so comfortable in my skin, skin, skin.... (Yeah... yeah...)

Maybe it's a cause for concern
But I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Prayin' to catch you whispering

I see you and me
Take my hand and we

Rise up, rise up little man
Don’t be scared I’m holding your hand
Know that life holds more than
What we see and what we get

For some strange reason
You're done pleasin' me like it's okay, ooh
Like a perm that's been left too long (it starts to burn)
The result is it just won't take, ooh
(I can see)
Now it's all coming so clear to me now

Misinterpreted all my naiveness
Was just thinking if I had no you than I can't do
My stock just went up over 2 million

Cause it gets no stronger
Ladies y'all know (yeah girl, ya'll know)
This pimp *ish gets no older

Yep! (that's another threat)
I'm immune, you can get no colder

Go, go, go, go

My love, my heart
Now we're facing the end
From what you did from the start, my love

When I know what I know,
And my female intuition

I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

Won't you ring the alarm?

But I'll be damn if I see another chick on your arm

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her
Is what I hate most
I don't want you but I want it
And I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

He's so arrogant and bold
Oh

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats

That's real nice and all that
It's been, it been good though
Cause it's been a year
It been real good
Cause it been so good
In the summertime all over again
Tell me somethin

(Beyonce)
Out of all the guys that approach me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiousity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

(Break - Beyonce - w/ ad libs)
I wanted more than just a man (man)
I needed a friend (I want a friend)
Someone I can talk to
Someone who'll really listen
When you touched my hand
The sun got brighter then
Trusting you I close my eyes
And felt our love begin

(Chorus - Beyonce)
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime

(Beyonce)
Now it's been a year and we're closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside
For me and now, you are my prize
Wanna grow old with ya
Fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you


A little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family

(Break - w/ ad libs)

(Ghostface Killah - talking behind Break)
I wanna understand everything you talk about baby
That's my word, cause I feel the same way
You know what I mean?
I've been feelin this way for a long time too
And a .. it's like I wanna be a daddy
I wanna be your lover
Your everything, I just wanna share life with you
Just like yo
That's why I tell you I love you

(Ghostface Killah)
I use to sit back and analyze on how we first met
A year ago on the barbershop steps
You and your friends walked past me
I called you back like "come here sexy have a word with you yet, please?"
Congratulations on bein my gift
God wrapped you up tight and he preserved my wish
I'm not a psychic it's just that I'm in tune with such
I swear the vibes got heavy when we got real close
My whole demeanor caused me to ask questions and stare at you strangely
Have I found my baby?
If so then tell me now
Look like you was 'bout to say somethin, you just broke a smile
Gave you the number and I said I'd dial (yeah)
A year later we on the block like "bow"
Tell me somethin, is it me or we up to somethin?
Love to love ya, your my friend and my woman

(Chorus)

(Ghostface Killah - talking)
This is Theodore, that's right
I keep hearin this all in my head over and over
I can't get it out, it's crazy
You know what I'm sayin baby
This joint is real, I like that
Tell me somethin

(Chorus)The way that I hit my damaged pride; 
You gave me away...

And I've had enough - I imagine the words I say to you...
I'm finding the strength to follow it through; 
I'm ready to change...

I'm letting go, I'm letting go!
We're only friends, we're only friends;
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls...

So let it show, so let it show...
We can't pretend, we can't pretend;
We only find ourselves by losing all
Control... 
Control...
Control...
Control...
Control... (Control...)
Control... (Control...)
Control... (Control...)
Control...

I'm opening up - Show me a sign I can't relieve...
These crazy emotions flow through me;
I'm gonna explode, oh!

You take me away from what is my ordinary life;
I won't be afraid of what we might find:
A love I can hold...

I'm letting go, I'm letting go!
We're only friends, we're only friends;
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls...

So let it show, so let it show...
We can't pretend, we can't pretend;
We only find ourselves by losing all
Control... 

Nothing ventured, nothing gained...
A new horizon ready to paint;
With every breath, you take it away...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

I'm letting go, I'm letting go!
We're only friends, we're only friends;
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls...

So let it show, so let it show...
We can't pretend, we can't pretend;
We only find ourselves by losing all

Yo me vestiría como quiero, 
con lo que vea primero y me voy.

Saldría a buscar,
chicas por montón.
Mis amigos que son leales,
siempre van acompañarme hasta el fin,
cada noche a mentir.

Si yo fuera un chico, 
sé que podría saber,
comprender mucho mejor,
lo que es amar a una mujer.

Sabría escuchar, 
pues conozco el dolor,
de perder a quién se quiere,
porque ignoras lo que tienes,
y quedas sin saber qué pasó.

Si yo fuera un chico,
pero ves no lo soy.
Los chicos son de molde,
y nosotras somos de corazón.

Se piensan que son,
los del sexo superior.
Pero cuando lo queremos,
los vence nuestra seducción, seducción.

Si yo fuera un chico,
sé que podría saber,
comprender mucho mejor, 
lo que es amar a una mujer.

Sabría escuchar, 
pues conozco el dolor,
de perder a quién se quiere,
porque ignoras lo que tienes,
y quedas sin saber qué pasó.

Es muy tarde, ya ves, para regresar.
Perdonarte otra vez,
ya no lo vas a lograr.
El lugar que ocupabas tu,
ya no está más.

Pero eres un chico, qué le vas hacer.
No puedes comprender,
que se siente al comprender mejor,
y amar en serio a una mujer.

No sabes escuchar.
No te importa el dolor.
Hasta que pierdes a quién quieres,
porque ignoras lo que tienes,
y quedas sin saber qué pasó.

Pero eres un chico...Babe

Where my thugs at?
White T-Shirt, I love that
Timberland boots, you does that, it's a fact
That's how I like it, baby

I like the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you dress
The way you smile
I like the way you are

It levels me, so please don't ever change

That's How You Like It, huh

I know you've heard I'm a gangsta
They say "Stay away from them gangstaz"
They never change up, or pull they pants up,
Well, baby girl, put ya foot down
Don't let'em push you around, you know what you like
Baby thug, you know wrong from right
You done felt grown before
This can't be what it feel like
And they don't really know whatcha feel like, for instance
They don't know the difference between real life
And the music videos & the raggedy magazines
They have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain't mad at you, it's just my Clyde
Way I wear my hat to the side
Way I lean real low when I ride
That's why my minds, they like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche
But of course
Most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty
Young Hovah & the Letter B

Maybe it's over, maybe we're through,
But I honestly can say I still love you...

Maybe we reached the mountain peak, and there's no more left to climb,
And maybe we lost the magic piece, and we're both too blind to find...

Let's start over - let's give love their wings;
Let's start over - stop fighting 'bout the same old thing...
Let's start over - we can't let our good love die;
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life...

I can see that we're not happy here,
So why would we keep pretending, when there's nothin' there?
Maybe you like it - well, I don't;
Maybe you settle - well, I won't!

Maybe we reached the mountain peak, and there's no more left to climb,
And maybe we lost that magic piece, and we're both too blind to find...

Let's start over - let's give love their wings;
Let's start over - stop fighting 'bout the same old thing...
Let's start over - we can't let our good love die;
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life...

I know that this will hurt you, I know you'll cry;
I know I called you selfish, but that's a lie...
I feel I know what's best for us;
Let's... 

Start over, and let's give love their wings;
Let's start over - I'm tired of fighting 'bout the same old thing...
Let's start over, yeah... We both know that this love won't die;

Let's pop a bottle of the vintage that I bought you
I model sexy pictures right on top of you
Ten years together still feels like we're making love for the first time
Like I'm in high school sneaking with my boyfriend

Part of this fortune, boy, I owe you
For being always there to talk to
Taking time out, starting with today
For my baby

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be our light tonight
Well I'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't got to worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be our light tonight
And I'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't got to worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Boy, if you just call, I'm on my way
When it comes to my baby I bring my best
I just wanna party tonight
'Cause it's obvious to see that you're where I wanna be

Just let me look at you
Ooh, you look so sexy, boy
I wanna taste
You already know which way
When I groove with you
You feel so good, boy, you're my favorite place
Just come and lay under me

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be our light tonight
I'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't got to worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

I wanna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be our light tonight
Well, I'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't got to worry 'bout a club

I may be young, but I'm ready to give you all my love;
I told my girls you can get it - Don't slow it down, just let it go...

So in love - I'll give it all away;
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow...
So tonight, I'll do it every way;
Speakers knockin' til the morning light, 'cause we like to party...

Hey... ay... (We likes to party...)

Your touch is driving me crazy - I can't explain the way I feel;
Top down, with the radio on, and the night belongs to us - Just hold me close, don't let me go...

So in love - I don't care what they say!
I don't curr if they talkin' tomorrow...
'Cause tonight's the night, uh-uh-uh-oh, that I give you everything,
Music knockin' 'til the morning light, 'cause we like to party!


Set the scene: 3000 degrees;
I ain't worried 'bout them fuck niggas over there, but they worried 'bout me...
I got a homeboy named Butta and another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese;
Fuck wit' me, baby - I make it milk 'til it drip down yo' knees...
Spit this shit fo' rillo... brain Brillo;
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old...
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero;
Man... we were just in the food court, eating our gyros...
Yesterday, that's the way - every single mornin', I try to pray;
Grandmama 'n' nem, they never forgot - nothin' else really mean nothin' to me...
I ain't studyin' the beat... Talkin' to me?
Girl, why you fuckin' wit' me? Move on, ain't nuttin' to see!
Sh... always sung this song - I'm the raw, off the rip;
'Cause of him, all of them, will remember the men,
And that they fell in love with rap - black like havin' your cousin back,
Blue like when that rent is due, cream like when I'm lovin' you, yeah...


So in love - I'll give it all away;
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow...
'Cause tonight's the night, uh-uh-uh-oh, that I give you everything,
Music knockin' 'til the morning light... cause we like to party!

You a bad girl, and your friends bad too, oh;
We got the swag sauce drippin' swagu... (Ooh...)I love the way you make me feel
It slows down time
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights

You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me
Lets me know you're mine

I'd rather be with you
Because I love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because
You hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy I'd rather be with you

I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes
What do they say to you
Boy don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies
Will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you

There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when I'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothing
Saving it all for you
Baby I love making love to you
It's like a high I can't come down from you

I'd rather be with you
Because I love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because
You hustle hard to take care of me

Nobody else but you babyBut you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

Solange: Don't try to tell me this ain't real
It's in the way he makes me feel
I think my baby is the one
It's in the way he holds it down

Beyoncé: I know you think that this is real
I know exactly how you feel
To young to know if he's the one
Girl you got time so slow it down

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

Solange: It's to complicated 
To explain my relationship
My friends are hating 
Cause they ain't feelin' what I'm feelin'
Leave me alone
And just let me be
Find your own thing
And get off of me

Beyoncé: It's not complicated girl
I've been where you are before
I'm not underrating
I'm just tryin' to protect your feelings
Solange listen to me understand what I'm saying
You'll realize one day
How much I care

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

Da Brat: Solange you might love the boy
Even sneak around the corner kiss and hug the boy
But Beyoncé been there before
And she wouldn't want anybody to hurt you 
Cause Matthew would drill the boy
And I can't ignore that you young
We just don't want you to get sprung
On some young dumb-dumb with no crumbs
Get all up in your heart and then run
Gettin' your heart broke is no fun
Neither is somebody telling you he not the one
You gotta learn for yourself though
And if you don't experience things 
Then you'll never know
I don't want you wishing
You coulda, shoulda, woulda did it
But you didn't
Listening to other people's advice
It's your life
Make your own decisions really

Solange: It's to complicated 
To explain my relationship
My friends are hating 
Cause they ain't feelin' what I'm feelin'
Leave me alone
And just let me be
Find your own thing
And get off of me

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

OooohYou're bad for me
I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me
Must be yo mission 
'Cause with every hug and kiss 
You're snatching every bit of strength
That I'm gon' need to fight off the inevitable 
And it's a heartbreaking situation
I'm up in but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do, 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I die

You ain't right take me high
Then that high, it subsides 
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive 
Wait, wait, wait... I'm alive
But how long will it last 
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down?

Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I die

It's just not my body (No), it's my mind
You don't know how many times I told myself, this can't do (Can't do)
And that I don't need you (No I don't need you)
It's so unfair, (Unfair) that I find myself right back in your care (Care)
And what's good is that when you are not always there (there, there)
You're no good for my health, my health
You're just like poison (ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)
You're just like poison (ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)

Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Baby kiss me one more time

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, ooh
You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I dieBut nine times outta ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed
I'm movin' on
I'll always be committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me would stop this love drought

You and me would stop this love droughtTo the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete
Listen
To the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release
Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I've followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I thought had died so long ago
Oh, I'm screaming out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worse
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I've followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't
Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start but I will complete

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I've followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've got to find my own, my ownLove will see us through if only you trust in me

She's stacking money, money everywhere she goes
You know, pesos out of Mexico
De uno, commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up, she professional
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy, oh no
She already made enough but she'll never leave

Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness

She works for the money, she work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar
And she worth every minute
She works for the money
She works for the money
She works for the money
She works for the money

She stack her money, money everywhere she goes
She got that Sake, her Yamazaki straight from Tokyo
Oh baby you know, she got them commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up cause she professional

Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness

She works for the money, she work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar
And she worth every minute

Stars in her eyes
She fights for the power, keeping time
She grinds day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday
She gon' slang
She too smart to crave material things
She pushing herself day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday
Oh, stars in her eyes
She fights and she sweats those sleepless nights
But she don't mind, she loves the grind
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday
Yeah, yeah, she gon' slang
Too smart to crave material things
Stacking her paper
Stacking her cake up
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday

Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness

She works for the money, she work for the money
From the start to the finish
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar
And she worth every minute

Oh, gonna make you feel
You always come back to me
Come back, come back
Come back, come back
Come back, come back, come backYou're the only image in my mind, so I still see you around...

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away...
Said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

The words don't ever seem to come out right, but I still mean them... Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel, but I still need to... Why is that?

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away...
I said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...
No matter who you love, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away... (But you're away...)
I said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...
No matter who you love, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...Would it change the sky tonight 
Would it give me some light 
Should I wait for you to call? 
Is there any hope at all 
Are you drifting by? 

When I think about it 
I know that I was never there or even cared 
The more I think about it 
The less that I was able to share with you 
I try to reach for you I, can almost feel you 
You're nearly here 
And then you disappear 
(Disappear, disappear, disappear) 
You disappear 
(Disappear, disappear, disappear) 

And when I lie all by myself 
I see your face, I hear your voice 
My heart stays faithful 
And time has come and time has passed 
If its good it's got to last 
It feels so right 

When I think about it 
I know that I was never there or even cared 
The more I think about it 
The less that I was able to share with you 
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you 
You're nearly here 
And then you disappear 
(Disappear, disappear, disappear) 
You disappear 
(Disappear, disappear, disappear) 
You, you disappear 

I missed all the signs 
One at a time you were ready 
What did I know starting our lives 
Now my love, I'm ready to shine 

When I think about it 
I know that I was never there or even cared 
The more I think about it 
The less that I was able to share with you 
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you 
You're nearly here 
And then you disappear 
You disappear, you disappear 
You disappear, disappearTalk your mess

But I'm not strong enough to cry 
Despite of my disguise 
I'm left with no shoulder 
But everybody wants to lean on me 
I guess I'm their soldier 
Well, who's gonna be mine 

Who's there to save the hero 
When she's left all alone 
And she's crying out for help 
Who's there to save the hero 
Who's there to save the girl 
After she saves the world 
After she saves the world 

I bottle all my hurt inside 
I guess I'm living a lie 
Inside my mind each day I die 
What can bring me back to life? 
A simple word, a gesture 
Someone to say you're beautiful 
Come find this buried treasure 
Rainbows lead to a pot of gold 

Who's there to save the hero 
When she's left all alone 
And she's crying out for help 
Who's there to save the hero 
Who's there to save the girl 
After she saves the world 
After she saves the world 

I've given too much of myself 
And now it's driving me crazy 
(I'm crying out for help?) 
Sometimes I wish someone would 
Just come here and save me 
Save me from myself 

Who's there to save the hero 
When she's left all alone 
And she's crying out for help 
Who's there to save the hero 
Who's there to save the girl 
After she saves the world 
After she saves the worldThem hustlers keep on talkin'

(If you want me you can watch me on your) Video phoneBike ride everyday on the bayou (You remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong 
You'd come home from work and I jumped in your arms when I saw you 
I was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)

Because you loved me I overcome
And I'm so proud of what you've become
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why

I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

I still remember the expression on your face 
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
(My first boyfriend, you should have seen your face)
I still remember I caught you crying 'cause of my tattoo
Could have said "Beyoncé, I told you so"
Instead you said you'd get one too
(Even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)

Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you protected me
Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why

I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it won't go away
I know I'm lucky
Know it ain't easy
Men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming
Can't help my tears from falling
I love you so much daddy

(Thank you, you've done so much for me. I love you, daddy.)

I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
There is no one else like my daddy
No one else replace my daddy(Beyonce:)

You know I slowed down once but I won't no mo'
Baby girl hold on, better buckle your seat belt

I know he tried to buy your heart with a black car
Big old mansion with a big old backyard
But if he was that smart
Homeboy would already know
You're the queen of your team, the hos got to go
Shorty lets roll if you ready to ride
You've been parked to long, let me put it in drive
Ain't nothin' like thug love, and thats real
I'm a lay back, you grab the wheel

Get the candles lit
Got to take advantage of every chance you get
So if ya'll ain't hear me B let 'em know

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
En el closet, en un rincón
Están tus cosas, esto se acabó

Te juro que no te aguanto más
No te quiero ya ni como amante
Esta vez no ganarás
Te puedes marchar y no vuelvas jamás

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
A olvidar tu amor

Ya me curé del dolor
Ya te saqué de mi corazón
Vete con ella, solos los dos
Pobre de ti, lárgate me das asco

Tú eras mi luz
Pero hay amores que matan de daño
Me cansé de ti
Ya no soy aquella infeliz

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor

Ya no soy nada para ti
Alguien que no conoces
Lo nuestro se acabó
Tanto daño al fin lo destruyó
Nunca lloraré por ti
Porque ya me cansé de ti
No eres más imprescindible

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé, mmm
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme

No hay más que hablar, terminamos
(¿Qué sabes tú de mí?)
Este cuento al fin se ha acabado
(No me hagas reír)
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amorbut you said that you would soon be home,
But, baby, that was a long time ago...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

On top of you not calling me back,
You see, I bet you think it's all on track,
And you actin' like it's alladat...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

Let's go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)

He don't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Quite frankly: (No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it...)

It's like we at two places, but different paces;
We in trouble, but you won't meet me at the bridge...
It hurts, and feels discerning;
Did you forget where your heart lives?

What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body;
Acting like I'm not nobody - You gon' make me call somebody...
What about my body, body? What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party - somehow, somewhere, I'll be naughty...

You know I hate sleeping alone, 
but you said that you would soon be home,
But, baby, that was a long time ago...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

On top of you not calling me back,
You see, I bet you think it's all on track,
And you actin' like it's alladat...

I think it's time to go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Heon't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Quite frankly: (No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it...)

(Let me show you how to get there.)
Take a left to compassion (lights will be flashin')
Keep straight and you'll see the sign right there:
Affection... (You're in the wrong direction...)
If I get caught, see, it just seems that you don't care...

What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body;
Acting like I'm not nobody - You gon' make me call somebody...
What about my body, body? What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party - somehow, somewhere, I'll be naughty...

You know I hate sleeping alone, 
but you said that you would soon be home, (You said you would soon be home...)
But, baby, that was a long time ago...

On top of you not calling me back,
You see, I bet you think it's all on track,
And you actin' like it's alladat... (Yo' sex ain't all that...)
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...) Let's go!

Let's go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
I think it's time to go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Heon't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Quite frankly: (No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it...)

I'm taking back the things I got from you, you,
And that includes my sweet little nookie too, too...

Let's go... (Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat;)
Kitty Kat. (He don't want you anymore... no...)
Uh, uh, uh...
Let's go... (Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat;)
Kitty Kat. (He don't want you anymore... no...)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

[Rap:]
Rock diamonds on my neck, got diamonds on my records;
Since 16, I was coming down ridin' Lexus'.
How you gon' neglect this? You is just a hot mess;
You can call Tyrone - You ain't gots to lie, Craig!

What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body?
I'm in the house all alone, you rather go and party?
What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body?
Acting like I'm nobody - You gon' make me call somebody...

Let's go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
I think it's time to go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
He ain't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it.And nothing like I thought you could've been 
But still you lived inside of me 
So tell me how is that 

You're the only one I wish I could forget 
The only one I loved and not forgive 
And though you've break my heart 
You're the only one 

And though there are times when I hate you 
Cause I can't erase 
The times that you hurt me 
And put tears on my face 
And even now I hate you it pains me to say 
I know I'll be there at the end of the day 

I don't wanna be without you baby 
I don't want a broken heart 
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby 
I don't want to play that part 
I know that I love you but let me just say 
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no 
I don't want a broken heart 
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl, no no 
No broken-hearted girl 

I'm no broken-hearted girl 

There's something that I feel I need to say 
But up 'til now I've always been afraid 
That you would never come around 
And still I wanna put this out 
You say you got the most respect for me 
But sometimes I feel your not deserving of me 
And still you're in my heart 
But you're the only one 

And yes there are times when I hate you 
But I don't complain 
Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away 
Oh but now I don't hate you I'm happy to say 
That I will be there at the end of the day 

I don't wanna be without you babe 
I don't want a broken heart 
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby 
I don't want to play that part 
I know that I love you but let me just say 
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no 
I don't want a broken heart 
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl 
No, no, no broken-hearted girl 

Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh 
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, mmm yeah 
I ain't got to be afraid, my broken heart is free 
To spread my wings and fly away 
Away without you
 
Yeah yeah yeah, oh ohh... 

I don't wanna be without my baby 
I don't want a broken heart 
Don't wanna take a breath without my baby 
I don't want to play that part 
I know that I love you but let me just say 
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no 
I don't want a broken heart 
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl 
No, no, no broken-hearted girl 
Broken-hearted girl, no, no 
No broken-hearted girl 
No broken-hearted girlKept my dick wet with his same old bet
You and your head high
And your tears dry get on without your guy

And I went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we been through
Oh,. and you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked, you'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I go back to her
And you go back to
You go back to

I love you much
It's not enough, I love blow and you love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
I go back to blackAnd my arms are getting tired
I'm trying to beat this emptiness but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand, and I can barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

I tried to be patient, but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely


And I'm scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared of the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost
In this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you, I'll stretch your hand looking for mine
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

(Chorus)

I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness
I think I'm drowning
I can't be lonely
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

(Chorus)That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how I like it, baby
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how I like it, baby
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how I like it, baby
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how I like it, baby

I need a thug that'll have my back
Durag, Nike Airs to match
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
That's how I like it, baby
Where my thugs at?
White T-Shirt--I love that
Timberland boots--you does that; it's a fact
That's how I like it, baby

I like the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you dress
The way you smile
I like the way you are
The way you ain't
I like your honesty, integrity
It levels me, so, please, don't ever change

[Chorus]

I like the way you brush your hair
I like the stylish clothes you wear
It's just the real things you do
That's why I want to stick with you
Where my girls at?
Let them know we love that
Sexy way they does that (you did that)
That's how I like it, baby

I hope you like my style
The way I dress
The way I flirt
Say yes
I hope you like my mind
The things I say
If I'm with you, then I'm with only you
My loyalty will never, ever change

[Chorus]

I know you heard I'm a gangsta
They say stay away from them gangstas
They never change up, or pull they pants up
Well, baby girl, put ya foot down
Don't let 'em push you around: you know what you like
Baby thug, you know wrong from right
You done felt grown before--this can't be what it feel like
And they don't really know what ya feel like, for instance
They don't know the difference between real life
And the music videos and the raggedy magazines
That have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain't mad at you: it's just my Clyde
The way I wear my hat to the side
The way I lean real low when I ride; that's why my mind's
They like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he comes back in a Porsche
But of course
But most of all they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty
Young 'Hov and the letter B
How you like that, huh?

[Chorus]It's a beautiful state we're in, but how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try...

We're nothing like we seem - passionate words are never spoken;
You don't know how I bleed when I leave your side...

In your eyes, love's alive;
We've come untied 'cause we're flashing by... like satellites.
Satellites...

Take all the rules away - how can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display - let's run and hide...

In our eyes, love's alive;
We've come untied 'cause we're flashing by... like satellites.
Satellites...

If we don't communicate, we'll exist in our own space...
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe...

Satellites flashing by...
Satellites...Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...
Uh-uh...

I said yes to your number, and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, we can be together, but you gotta wait for me..."
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)
I said, "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me..."
But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully;
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)

You was on the wall, I was with my crew;
You was watching me, baby, I was watching you...
Slowly, you walked over - I maintained my cool;
You said hello to me, I said hello to you...
You asked me where I'm from, I asked you what you do;
You somehow intrigued me - I thought you were so cool...
Somewhere between hi and goodbye, I felt so comfortable;
I felt like we could talk all night, so I gave my number to you...

I said yes to your number, and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, we can be together, but you gotta wait for me..."
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)
I said, "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me..."
But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully;
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)

"Certainly you can call me, baby, I love to hear from you..."
"Yes, of course, you can come and see me, boy;
Wanna get to know you more, sure, I’m feelin' you..."
"No, baby, not yet, we can’t take that next step;
Why you gettin’ so upset? Boy, you
Act as though I never told you yes before - You are so ungrateful! Mm-mm-mm..."

You was at my house, I was sittin' on my couch;
You was really buggin', so I told you to get out...
I had been misjudging you - You had a lot of nerve;
You too damn old to be so immature! I hope you learn...
You said I move too slow, I showed you to the door;
You said you'd call me later, I said, "Don't call no more..."
It is cool if you can't wait for me, I'm glad you let me know,
'Cause you showed me your true face, baby, the first time I said no...

I said yes to your number, (Yes...) and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, (Ooh...) we can be together, but you gotta (Mm-mm...) wait for me..."
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)
(Ooh, I said yes!) I said "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me..."
(Oh...) But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully;
(The very first time I say no...) The first time I say "No," it’s like I never said "Yes..." (It's like I never said "Yes..." before...)

I said yes to your number, and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, we can be together, but you gotta wait for me..."
The first time I say "No," it’s like I never said "Yes..." (It's like I never said "Yes...")She aint yo average chick, back up.

For this type of girl its not that hard.
You see her 'cause she's too far gone.

Crazy feelings 
Make me stay in love wit you

Make me stay in love wit you (repeat until end)I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor gets into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na

Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded

Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?", oh baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints with my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7 Eleven
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing on it
If you scared, call that reverend

Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
New sheets, he sweat it out like wash rags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic till my voice hoarse

Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerve, surfing all of this good, good

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?", oh baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love


Hold up
That D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house time back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that Third, wanna see all that shit I heard

Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off, on sight

Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"

I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights, you gon' need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breasteses is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night


We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

Never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keeping me on fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire

I've been drinking watermelon
(I want your body right here, daddy I want you, right now)
Can't keep ya eyes off my fatty
Daddy I want you

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, loveIt's so much that I could never say to your face
But by now
You should know the world and all its ways
So find your place

How do I find words that do not condescend
When she bore you before me
'Cause she doesn't need a child she needs a friend
A son, not a sob story, ooh


And your priority it must be heard

'Cause we'll never be the way we were, oh

She can't always be there just to hold you down
Our mother
When you are at a age now, well life turns around
My brother

Realize that you don't have to answer to no man
Responsibility comes down to you
But how can I expect you to understand
When you live life like it's so run-through
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo


And your priority, it must be heard

'Cause we'll never be the way we were

The way we were
We'll never be
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
At your priority, it must be her
ooh, ooh, hooI sat close to the front so I could see
Your enthusiastic demonstrations
Teaching to a class of only me
And I couldn't speak directly to you
Without stuttering or turning red
So, looking back
I don't know how I handled itHis hair was exactly the shade of brown
He's just not as tall, but I couldn't tell
It was dark and I was lying down

You are everything, he means nothing to me
I can't even remember his name
Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I came

What do you expect? You left me here alone
I drank so much and needed to touch
Don't overreact, I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely

How can I put it so you understand? 
I didn't let him hold my hand
But he looked like you
I guess he looked like you
No, he wasn't you
But you can still trust me, this ain't infidelity
It's not cheating, you were on my mind
Yes, he looked like you
But I heard love is blindI understand a man confused
They're much too big, but I don't care
I feel the weight your shoulders bear
Now I really empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you, you so frustrated
But we all become what we once hated
Besides, nobody can be that wise

I can't help you if you won't help yourself (help yourself, help yourself)
I can't help you if you don't help yourself (help yourself)
You can only get so much from someone else (You can get so much from me)
I can't help you if you won't help yourself (help yourself)

You got a degree in philosophy
So you think you cleverer than me (cause you so smart)
But I'm not just some drama queen (drama queen)
Cause it's where you're at, not where you've been
So what do you expect from me
To hold your head above the sea (keep you high and dry)
And carry you, even though you bigger
Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure
And anyway, we're still so young (yeah, I'm so young) 
And this isn't yesterday 

I can't help you if you won't help yourself, I can't help you
I can't help you if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone else
I can't help you if you won't help yourself

You might be twenty-five, but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years old most of the time
And I, I'm just a child and you full grown
And it was like nothing that I've ever known
You are like nothing that I ever knewAnd Mr Jones (Me and Mr Jones) 

What kind of fuckery is this? 
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig (oh Slick Rick) 
You thought I didn't love you when I did (when I did) 
Can't believe you played me out like that (Ahhh) 

No you ain't worth guest list 
Plus one of all them girls you kiss (all them girls) 
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (to yourself) 
Can't believe you played yourself (out) like this 

Rulers one thing but come Brixton 
Nobody stands in between me and my man 
'Cause it's me and Mr Jones (Me and Mr Jones) 

What kind of fuckery are we? 
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me (dick to me) 
I might let you make it up to me (make it up) 
Who's playing Saturday? 

What kind of fuckery are you? 
Side from Sammy you're my best black Jew 
But I could swear that we were through (we were through) 
I still want to wonder 'bout the things you do 

Mr Destiny 9 and 14 
Nobody stands in between me and my man 
'Cause it's Me and Mr JOnes (Me and Mr Jones)You need the nerd to hide your ego, don't come with that
You think everything is handed to you free
But it's not that easy, no

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

My girl says I'm too sensitive to run with you
But I'm not listening to her, mmhm
Yes, I'm perceptive, so when I'm done with you 
You'll wish your head back the way it were as you were

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

Oh, I'm not ruling you out
I'm just in doubt as to
What you say you're all about, yeah

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and then
I gotta know you now and then

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again 
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now
We may never meet againTied up enough so I don't have to wonder, 
Got so sick of crying, so just lately
When I catch myself, I do a 180

I stay up, clean the house, at least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking 
That silent sense of content that everyone gets 
Just disappears soon as the sun sets 

He is fierce in my dreams seizes my guts 
He floods me with dread 
Soaked in soul 
He swims in my eyes by the bed 
Pour myself over him 
Moon spilling in 
And I wake up alone

As far as my heart, I'd rather be restless 
The second I stop, the sleep catches up and I'm breathless 
This ache in my chest as my day is done now 
The dark covers me and I cannot run now 

My blood running cold, I stand before him 
It's all I can do to assure him 
When he comes to me, I drip for him tonight 
Drowning in me we bathe under blue light

He is fierce in my dreams seizes my guts 
He floods me with dread 
Soaked in soul 
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him 
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone 

And I wake up alone 
And I wake up alone 
And I wake up aloneI do pretty well till after sundown and suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad, 'round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight, 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
So when my heart is still with you
Yes ol' midnight knows it, too

For 'round midnight, when it comes around
So let our hearts take wings 'round midnight, 'round midnight
Let the angels sing for your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around, cause I'm feelin' sad,
And it really gets bad 'round midnight, 'round midnightLove is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is a losing game

One I wish I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the Gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing gameHuggin' up to big monkey man

I never saw ya, I only heard of you
Huggin' up to big monkey man

It's your life, it's your life
Huggin' up to big monkey man

Now I know that now I understand
Huggin' up to big monkey man

La-la-la, la-la-la
Huggin' up to big monkey manTomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true

And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips that I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true

And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

All my loving, I will send to you

All my loving, darling I'll be true

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true

And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

All my loving, I will send to you
All my loving, darling I'll be true
All my loving, all my loving
Ooh, all my loving, I will send to youYou're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you did behave

Curtain has fallen, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait

You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end

Curtain has fallen, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait

You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you did behave

You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the endWhile you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro red

So now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah

And although my pride is not easy to disturb
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With you battered jeans and your beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me

And although he is nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to blugdeon my futile tears
And I'm not used to this, I observe, I don't chase
So now I'm stuck with consequences thrust in my face, yeah

And the melodramas of my day deliver blows
That surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be, yeah

And although my pride's not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With you battered jeans, yeah, and your beastie's tee
Now I can't work like this with you next to me

His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down I'll get it off my mind
Oh, it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks, yeah
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks

And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you get my number down and such
But I've never hated myself for my age so much, yeah

And although my pride's not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with you battered jeans, and your beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me, yeah

And although my pride's not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah, and your beastie tee


Her name is Cherry, we've just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me after eighteen years
And you still don't see me like you ought to do

Maybe we could talk 'bout things 
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to turn you down

You're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back, you stubborn as a mule

Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitarLike you did in the beginning
It's not that we grew apart
A nightingale no longer singing

It's something I know you can't do
Separate sex with emotion
I sleep alone, the sun comes up
You're still clinging to that notion

Everything is slowing down
River of no return
Recognize my every sound
There's nothing new to learn

You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night

Want the same thing when we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
A different way from where I'm going

Oh, it's you again
Listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head

Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my bed

I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did

Now it's not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night 
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right

Everything is slowing down
River of no return
You recognise my every sound 
There's nothing new to learn

You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night

Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
It's a different way from where I'm going

Oh, it's you again
Listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head

Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my ba ba dee dee bedWell babe, don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Go on, teach me tonight

Starting with the ABC of it
Right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Go on, teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me tonight

I'll use that star to write "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Oh oh teach me...
Oh oh
Teach me tonightUnsurprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we're best friends, right?
You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat when you're home at night
But we are best friends, right?

You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between

Nicky's right when he says "I can't win"
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about how you feel inside
But we are best friends, right?
I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame, blame
Now you want me to suffer just 'cause you was born wide
But we are best friends, right?

You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between

I had love for you when I was four
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla, and you get the draw

'Cause we are best friends, right, right, right, right?
'Cause we are best friends, right?
Because we are best friends, right?Whoa
My Man Is In A Car Accident
He Really Did Mean All The Things He Meant
He In The Emergency Room
Looking Crazy Like A Fool
Shit I Oughta Shoot Him With My Gun
Boom,Boom!
Ray You Know You Treated Me Wrong
This Is Why I Am Singing This Song

There He Goes With One Leg
Pushed Him Down In the Tub

When I Was In My Bed
Didn't Need No Man

Standing up On Me
This Morning He Had A Wheelchair

Please Leave And Get Out Wih Your Hooooooooooooo
HDistract me, stops me doin' work I hate
Just to show him how it feels
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair

Amy, Amy, Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy, Amy, Amy
He's just too hard to ignore

Masculine, you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy, Amy, Amy
Where's my moral parallel

It takes me, half an hour to write a verse
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
My weakness for the other sex
Every time his shoulders flex
The way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track

Amy, Amy, Amy
Although I've been here before 
Amy, Amy, Amy 
He's just too hard to ignore

Masculine, he spins a spell, yeah
I think he'd wear me well
Amy, Amy, Amy
So where's my moral parallel

His own style, right down to his Diesel jeans
Immobile, I can't think by any means
Underwear peeks out the top
I'll let you know when you should stop
From the picture my mind drew
I know I'd look good on you

Amy, Amy, Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy, Amy, Amy 
You're too hard to ignore

Masculine, you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy, Amy, Amy
So where's my moral parallel

Creative energy abused
All my lyrics go unused
When I clock black hair blue eyes
I drift off, I fantasize

Amy, Amy, Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy, Amy, Amy
He's just too hard to ignore

Masculine, he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy, Amy, Amy
So where's my moral parallel

Amy, Amy, Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy, Amy, Amy
He's just too hard to ignore

Masculine, he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy, Amy, Amy
Where's my moral parallelIs to love, love, love him
Just to see that smile, 
makes my life worth while, 
to know, know, know him 
is to love love love him
and I do, I do, and I do

Oh I'll be good to him,
I'll bring joy to him,
oh everyone says they'll come a day 
when I'll walk along side of him

To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do, I really do, and I do

Why can't he see,
how blind can he be, 
someday he'll see,
that he was meant for me,
Oh, Oh, to know know know him
is to love love love him

Just to see that smile
oh it makes me life worth while
to know know know him 
is to love love love him
and I do, I really do, and I doMeet you downstairs in the bar and heard

Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt

You say, "What did you do with him today?"

And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray



'Cause you're my fella, my guy

Hand me your Stella and fly

By the time I'm out the door

You tear me down like Roger Moore



I cheated myself

Like I knew I would

I told ya I was troubled

You know that I'm no good



Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy

He's in the place, but I can't get joy

Thinking of you in the final throes

This is when my buzzer goes



Run out to meet your chips and pitter

You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter

There'll be none of him no more

I cried for you on the kitchen floor



I cheated myself

Like I knew I would

I told ya I was troubled

You know that I'm no good



Ayo, I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you

Temperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you

Let me ride with you, talk about your mistakes

You cheated yourself but these are the breaks

And it never be the same again, cause of old boy

But oh boy, together we make so much joy

In the sands and oh, what a wet, wee-wee

But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and

Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks

Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and

Act like we can rekindle that flame

It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain

He that lame, you love how I bring the pain

Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name

Say my name, that's right, I'm high post

Get the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast



I cheated myself

Like I knew I would

I told you I was trouble

You know that I'm no good



I cheated myself

Like I knew I would

I told you I was trouble

Yet you know that I'm no goodThe girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes each one she passes
Goes ..

When she walks it's just like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes
Goes ..

Ooh! how I watch her so sadly
How, I cannot tell her love her
Yeah! I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and Tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking now
When she passes,
I go...
the girl the girl the girl from Ipanema
from Ipanema ...
 
Oh, Yeah I want her so badly 
How, how can I tell her I love her
Yeah, I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walk to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and Tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes I smile but she doesn't see
She ain't looking at me
OoohSome guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Girls you know you betta watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Girls you know you betta watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thingNeed to get my thoughts down but it's getting late
Need to get up now, get my feet on the ground
But the show is so unprepared now

My place so messed up, I tried on some shoes
Should think clear and focus but I've things to do
Glancing at my CD rack, eyes linger on Frank
And I must put that check in the bank

Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I will finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Always got something to do, someone to be seeing
Somewhere to be dancing, I'm a wake human being
It's an opportunity, shout till you go blue
Unless I wanna do it, your words go through

Need to buy some cigarettes, can't put it off any longer
Worked appeal depression, I feel it growing stronger
Maybe when I'm all grown up, I will get it through
But right now I got stuff to do

Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Gotta get this song down before I leave tonight
But my hair, just does it's own thing and I gotta look alright
And I gotta write a chorus but words allude me now
I have to get this down before I leave somehow

And anyway I be thinkin' to meet you at the station
Guilty 'cause I should be home, damn procrastination
So when they ask me later, I won't tell them how it's going
But now my head is empty and the work load keeps on growing

Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio, I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Put me in a room, distraction less
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
Tempted to work

Distraction less
Spare me from worse
I would finally burn
Tempted to workI would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fighting for

He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow

We put it in writing
But who you writing for
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done, reciting
My stomach standing still
Like you're reading my will

He still stands in spite of what his scars say
And I'll battle till this bitter finale
Just me, my dignity and this guitar case

Yes my man is fighting some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
Who you dying for
B - I would have died too 
I'd of liked to

If my man was fighting some unholy war 
If my man was fightingPretty baby you are the soul, snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me 
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Very close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just let me get next to you

So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky, how I worry 'bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love

So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again
Baby won't you come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you 
And get a release from this awful misery

What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore
Not like before, can't you understand me
Don't you understand me, now baby please
Pull yourself together, do it very soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet

Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land 

Maybe there we can find
A good place to keep a lovin' state of mind
I'm so tired of being without it
And never knew what love was all about
James Moody would you come on hit me, 
You can blow now if you want to, I'm throughYes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time, and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab, I won't go, go, go

I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway

I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

They tried to make me go to rehab, I said: "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time, and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab, I won't go, go, go

The man said: "Why you think you're here?"
I said: "I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near"

He said: "I just think you're depressed"
this, me, yeah, baby, and the rest

They tried to make me go to rehab, I said: "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know

I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, oooh, just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

And It's not just my pride
It's just 'till these tears have dried

They tried to make me go to rehab, I said: "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time, and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab, I won't go, go, goGone to find her big blue jay
Starlight, before she took flight
I sung a lullaby of bird land every night
I sung a lullaby every night
Sung for my Ava every night

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

With dread, I woke in my bed
To shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Spoke until one day she couldn't be heard
She spoke until one day she couldn't be heard
She just stopped singing

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise
She flies in paradiseMy hands were made for you
And you always give me
Stress me free point of view
Pick you up after school

 Take a token
 Of my love
 I see you through the smoke

Without you, a misery
Blue with a migraine
All the songs sound better
When you're next to me
Hey, 'cause they come naturally

 Take a token
 Of my love
 I see you through the smoke

Laying on my bed
I reach over for you
And you so fresh
You even make the standards bloom
But its just to you through

 Take a token
 Of my love
 I see you through the smoke





Waiting for the smoke to clear
I'm waiting for the smoke to clearAnd let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please, hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

I don't want to bother you, but I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all my happiness
For I love a man who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix, so

Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, if your arrow makes his love strong for me
I swear I'm gonna love him 'til eternity
I know that 'tween the both of us, his heart we can steal
Help me if you will, so

Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please, hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Hey, Cupid
Oh, Cupid
Mmm, CupidI bet you wonderin'
How I knew
'Bout your plans
To make me blue
With some other guy
You knew before
Between two of us guys
You know I love you more

It took me by surprise
I must say
When I found you yesterday
Don't you know that
I heard it
Through the grapevine
Not much longer
Would you be mine
Uhh, uhh
Heard it through
The grapevine
Oh
I'm just about
To lose my mind
Honey, honey
Oh, baby
Ooh ooh honey honey
I know a man
Ain't supposed to cry
But these tears
I can't hold inside
Losin' you
Would end my life
You see
Cause you mean
That much to me
You could have
Told me yourself
That you loved
Someone else

Instead
I heard it
Through the grapevine
Not much longer
Would you be mine
Ohh
I heard it
Through the grapevine
And I'm just
About to lose my mind
Honey, honey
People say believe
Half of what you see
Oh, and none
Of what your hear
But I can't help
But be confused
If it's true
Please tell me dear
Do you plan
To let me go
For the other guy
You loved before?Says that love is blind
Still we're often told
Seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek
A certain lad
I've had in mind

Looking everywhere
Haven't found him yet
He's the big affair
I cannot forget
Only man I ever think
Of with regret

I'd like
To add his inital
To my monogram
Tell me
Where is the shepherd
For this lost lamb?

There's a somebody
I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns
Out to be
Someone to watch over me

I'm a little lamb
Who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Always be good
To one
Who'll watch over me

Although he may
Not be the man some
Girls think
Of as handsome
To my heart
He carries the key

Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over meWhen you were 15
You wore it to the disco
When everyone was in jeans

But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your low-cut dresses threw stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?

You left for London
When you were 19
Had to pawn all your nice clothes
Just living on dreams

A man in a bright light
Took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom
For a taste unknown

But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?

Hey little rich girl
You've been away for so long (oh)
And now little rich girl
I wrote you in this song (woo woh)
Hey little rich girl
Baby love has gone 
And now little rich girl
I know where you belong

At your dad's office party
All the movies were blue
You caused him so much heartache
Cos the ‘screen-star' was you

You left for London
When you were 19
Had to pull off your nice clothes
Just living on dreams

But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?

Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?It's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones)

What kind of fuckery is this?
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig (oh Slick Rick)
And thought I didn't love you when I did (when I did)
Can't believe you played me out like that

No, you ain't worth guest list
Plus one of all them girls you kiss (all them girls)
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (to yourself)
Can't believe you played yourself like this

Rulers one thing, but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones)

What kind of fuckery are we?
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me (dick to me)
I might let you make it up to me (make it up)
Who's playing Saturday?

What kind of fuckery are you?
Side from Sammy, you're my best black Jew (best black Jew)
But I could swear that we were through (we were through)
I still wonder 'bout the things you do

Mr. Destiny, 9 and 14
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones)That her man will leave his mark on her hand
He's not all he seems
But she's seen a dress, she has the flowers planned
Now she won't be happy
Till she look down and sees the engagement ring
It's for security
But she will be waiting years for her wedding

(chorus)

For me it aint real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh 
For me it aint real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told

He won't change her life
He just chasing tail
And wasting her time
She calls herself his wife
He calls her at 8 says be here by 9
She don't notice how when she gets the ring
It's not a good fit
So next time that they row


She throws it out
It goes to the last girl he hit

(chorus)

Cuz for me it aint real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it aint real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told

So take the gold you find 
And for your own sake
Hold it in your hand
Now make sure you bite down
And watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band

(chorus)

For me it aint real
It's fools gold 
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it aint real
Yes it's fools goldMe crowd loves me
F**k Me up for this amazing situation.

How come your lonely
Come to me and you won't be
Get ready for our pipes

Your rotten and old 
I'm over you

Your a f**kin' tatter
Boring and seen

In the house
Big brother tv 'amazing'

Get ready for meAnd we'll have everything
We'll share the joy (We'll share the joy)
Falling in love can bring
No one can tell me 
That I'm too young to know (Young to know)
I love you so (Love you so)
And you love me

Our day will come (Our day will come)
If we just wait a while
No tears for us (No tears for us)
Think love and wear a smile

Our dreams have magic
Because we'll always stay in love this way
Our day will come
(Our day will come, our day will come)

Ooh...
Ooh...

Our dreams have magic
Because we'll always stay in love this way

Our day will come 
(Our day will come, our day will come)
Our day will come 
(Our day will come, our day will come)
Our day will come 
(Our day will come, our day will come)
Our day will come 
(Our day will come, our day will come)
Our day will comeAnd this regret I got accustomed to
Once it was so right when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night

I knew I hadn't met my match but every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I don't understand, why do I stress a man
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all, we had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal

Even if I stop wanting you, and perspective pushes true
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again, I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

So we are history, your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I wish I could say no regrets and no emotional debt
'Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in my blue shade
My tears dry on their own

Whoa, he walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way my deep shade
My tears dry on their own

He walks away the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way my deep shade
My tears dryTo buy his own weed and don't wear my shit down
I wouldn't care if he would give me some more
I'd rather him leave you than leave him my 'dro
When you smoke all my weed man,
You gotta call the green man
So I can get mine
And you get yours

Once is enough to make me attack
So bring me a bag and your man can come back
I'll check him at the door make sure he got green
I'm tighter than airport security teams

When you smoke all my weed man
You gotta call the green man
So I can get mine and you get yours

I'm my own man
So when will you learn
That you got a man, but I got to burn
Don't make no difference if I end up alone
I'd rather have myself a smoke my homegrown
It's got me addicted, does more than any dick did
Yeah, I can get mine and you get yours
Yeah, I can get mine and you get yoursThe lights are on, but no one's home 
She is so vacant, her soul is taken 
He thinks: "What she's running from?"

Now, how can he have her heart 
Oh when it got stole
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies (never dies, woohoo)

Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses, the man she misses
The man that he longs to be

Now, how can he have her heart 
Oh when it got stole
So he tries to pacify her 
'Cause what's inside her never dies (never dies)

So he tries to pacify her 
'Cause what's inside her, it never dies, woahoo
So he tries to pacify her 
But what's inside her never dies (da, da, da, da, wooh)But I think I was dreaming he didnt feel quite right 
I pressed his chest under my fingertips
Beside myself I sighed and reminded of his lips

I'm confused and quizical
Funny once you know
I just wan get physical 
Let me tell ya how 

Do me good I'll tell you anything you want to hear 
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good 
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear 
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good 

It's like he was designed with me in mind 
He's so good from behind
He's beautifully defined 
I miss him most of all when it got late 
Attempt to hear him breathing 
Or feel his shifting weight 

I'm confused and quizical
Funny once you know
I just wan get physical 
Let me tell ya how 

Do me good I'll tell you anything you want to hear 
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good 
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear 
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me goodI'd take a thousand thumps for my love
'Cause you kissed a lucky horseshoe
Stuck it in my boxing glove
Does anyone who will listen up
To our victories and dumb defeats
Knows they all take you to the cleaners
If you come between the cheats

1-Between the cheats
Between the cheats

My husband is the finest handsome hustler
And he still makes this housewife blush
So I go with him, my hand flicks
I'm sitting on the royal flush
Women drink him in, swim in him with green eyes
Then go home and catch the chips you've got
And here maybe two, oh, two bottles of
The jack of hearts is my jackpot

Repeat 1

'Cause we all have to lock eyes
And I know is my heartbeat
There's a winning secret to both
And it's sworn between the cheats

Repeat 1 (2x)You been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am

You always wanna talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role

Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay,
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do. Are you gay?

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

He said, 
I said, 
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script

I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than meI've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly, but darlin', can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darlin', can't you please see through me
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together

Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together

We were alone and I was singing this song for you
We were alone and I was singing this song for youSo I punched all the buzzers, hoping you wouldn't be there
And now my head's hurting, you say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there, and I'd have wanted to stay 
But I got nothing to say

You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say, man, that was ugly

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there, and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it, take the box, take the box

I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter but that's not me, you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen,I said goodbye to your bedroom
And smelled of you

Mr. False Pretense, you don't make sense, I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye? I think I love you

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Now take it, take the box
Just take it, take it take the box
And now just take the box, take the boxIt's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine?

[Chorus]
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

Play all my records, keep dancing all night
But leave me alone for a while
'Til Johnny's dancing with me,
I've got no reason to smile

[Chorus]
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

[Instrumental Bridge]

Judy and Johnny just walked through the door
Like a queen with her king
Oh, what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring

[Chorus]
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
[repeat and fade out]But I'm not always forward thinking
I'll tell you what you want to hear
It depends on what I've been drinking

'Cause everything I do or say
Makes it hard for you to stay
We both know, What it is

Nowadays we talk too much
Like you're forgetting all the good shit
You decide whats wrong with me
I always used to let you say
But now I like to think out loud
You're running with some different crowd
We both know, What it is

I don't know you anyomore, supposed to be the man, that I live my life by
And you're attitudes become a bore
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry, cry

Mr Ultra Sensitive
I'll never let myself forget you
Messed each other up you know
So I'm sorry if I upset you
Tomorrow is another day so I'll call you cause that's OK
We both know, What it is

I don't know you anyomore, supposed to be the man, that I live my life by, I live my life
And your attitudes become a bore
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry, I cant even cry

Relationship doesn't remain
we resonate on different flames
I could cut you down again
If you was like all other men
If you were like all other men
I know that I could shut you down again
But my friend, but my friend

I don't know you anyomore, supposed to be the man, that I live my life by, I live my life
Your attitudes become a bore
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry

I don't know you anyomore, supposed to be the man, that I live my life by
Your attitudes become a bore
And I'm so tired, I can't even cryIt's never safe for us
Not even in the evening 'cause I've been drinking
Not in the morning when your shit works
It's always dangerous when everybody's sleeping 
And I've been thinking
Can we be alone
Can we be alone

When will we get the time to be just friends
When will we get the time to be just friends

And no I'm not ashamed
But the guilt will kill you
If she don't first
I'll never love you like her

Though we need to find a time to just do this shit together
For it gets worse
I want to touch you
But that just hurts

When will we get the time to be just friends
When will we get the time to be just friends
Just friends

When will we get the time to be just friends
When will we get the time to be just friends
Just friendsOkay, Johnny Mas, you all having too much fun

Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Ah, won't you come on over
And stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Did you have to go to jail
Put your house up for sale
Did you get a good lawyer
Hope you didn't catch a tan
Hope you'll find the right man
Who'll fix it for ya

Are you shopping anywhere
Change the color of your hair
Are you busy
And did you have to pay that fine
You was dodging all the time
Are you still busy

Since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over. Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're
And in my head I paint a picture

Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Ah, won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Mm, Valerie
Valerie
Oh, Valerie
Valerie
Why don't you come on over, ValerieRockin' your fuck me pumps
And the men notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to

'Cause you all look the same everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night 'cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer's wife

You don't like players that's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers they don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller

You're more than a fan lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night stands
He could be your whole life if you got past one night
But that part never goes right

In the morning you're vexed he's onto the next
And you didn't even get no text
Don't be too upset if they call you a sket
'Cause like the news everyday you get pressed

You don't like players that's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
Or them big ballers don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller

You can't sit down right 'cause your jeans are too tight
And you're lucky it's ladies' night
With your big empty purse every week it gets worse
At least your breasts cost more than hers

So you did Miami 'cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E, met somebody
And spent the night getting caned

Without girls like you there'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you there's no nightlife
All those men just go home to their wives

Don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump that you'd always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumpsI never wanted you to be my man
I just need your company 
Don't wanna get dependent on 
Your time or who you spent it on 
Or lose the way you love me
Like smoke
I hung around in the unbalanced

Whoa
Whoa


It's not a movie, this is not a script or proofread
I'll spit some untruths to dumb fools and groupies 
Fun to punctuate, pronunciate the funds I make ? put in your face 
Oh my mistake, you're not a floosy? Then excuse me 
Before I talk, my style introduced me
Get your name and phone number like 1-2-3 
Y'all know the story, y'all know the commentary 
I kick the narrative, this is legendary 
The good Samaritan, hood thespian
Like a polygamist, with a twist
Will I marry again? Maybe, I guess 
I hold a lady's interest, I just met 
The love scholar, she the teacher's pet
Every other eve we meet and make each other sweat 
I feel triumphant, no strings
Just a fling to have fun with
I be out in London, Camden
Huntin' for the answers, why did God take away the homie?
I can't stand it 
I'm a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
Just hope the big man show me some courtesy 
Why? 'Cause I'm deemed a heart breaker 
Like smoke, girls lean 'round a player 
Yeah, yeah


I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company 
Don't wanna get dependent on 
Your time or who you spent it on 
Or lose the way you love me
Like smoke
I hang around in the unbalanced

Whoa
Yeah
Oh, oh, whoo
Oh
Whoa
Oh, oh, oh


Yo, this recession is a test
It's affecting my complexion 
Misdirection my affection
My concerns are bill collections
The facts is the taxes, they after me 
Chapter three, my property
My handlers, they dealt with me improperly 
I say some things I should probably keep privately
Evaluate the world bank trusts like I'm IEG Those fly suites and my boojwazi 
Tall freak, she wouldn't protest with me at Wall Street
She says, no you're so deep
I said, no let's go through it
Historically so ruthless feds came for Joe Louis
She said, my man you need to laugh sometimes
Classify me as a whore, I tell her have some wine
You colder than penguin poo, in her dismay
She's thinkin' that's just so silly to say
But if you really think about it hussy 
See a penguin, he drags his shit on the ground all day
And there's a dragon ? 
I'm through with you after I crush, so is that humorous enough?
The smoke I puff
Tell the car to go to Aura, Funky Buddah, Whisky Mist on Mayfair
I hope I meet Monie Love so she can show me love
NYC to UK I might stay there
Everybody in the club tonight say, "Yeah"
You know how me and Amy are straight players


Whoa
Oh, oh, oh

I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company 
Don't wanna get dependent on 
Your time or who you spent it on 
Or lose the way you love me
Like smoke
I hang around in the unbalanced

Whoa
Oh
Ooh, oh
Hey
Oh, oh
Ooh
Oh
Whoa
Oh, oh, ohI know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need
To see me through

Sometimes it seems the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need
To see me through

When food is gone you are my daily meal, oh
When friends are gone I know my savior's love is real
Your love is real

'Cause you got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

Time after time I think "Oh Lord what's the use?"
Time after time I think it's just no good
'Cause sooner or later in life, the things you love you loose
But you got the love I need
To see me through

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
'Cause I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need to see me throughSo when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place

And it overpowers me
I can't help but dance

You can try to stop me now
But you won't get the chance

Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change

Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And I swallowed it whole

You should thank your lucky stars
Cause the music is a gift
And it's stronger than all else
Provides me with the bliss

Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change

My lyrics revealing
Some natural vibe
It's a kind of laid back feeling
Oh just let it ride

And when Frank Sinatra sings
It's too much to take
So I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache

Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the changeYour rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "What did you do with him today?"
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex boy
He's in a place but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet you, chips and pita
You say "When we're married" cause you're not bitter
"There'll be none of him no more,"
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
Who truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yeah, you know that I'm no goodBut already she knows me better than you
She understands me
After eighteen years
And you still don't see me
Like you ought to do
Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to tune you down
You're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back
You're stubborn as a mule
Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitarRockin' your fuck me pumps
And the men notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to

'Cause you all look the same everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night 'cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer's wife

Don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty

You should have known from the jump that you'd always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumpsHis hair was exactly the shade of brown
He's just not as tall, but I couldn't tell
It was dark and I was lying down

You are everything, he means nothing to me
I can't even remember his name
Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I came

What do you expect? You left me here alone
I drank so much and needed to touch
Don't overreact, I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely

How can I put it so you understand? 
I didn't let him hold my hand
But he looked like you
I guess he looked like you
No, he wasn't you
But you can still trust me, this ain't infidelity
It's not cheating, you were on my mind
Yes, he looked like you
But I heard love is blindYou need the nerd to hide your ego, don't come with that
You think everything is handed to you free
But it's not that easy, no

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

My girl says I'm too sensitive to run with you
But I'm not listening to her, mmhm
Yes, I'm perceptive, so when I'm done with you 
You'll wish your head back the way it were as you were

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

Oh, I'm not ruling you out
I'm just in doubt as to
What you say you're all about, yeah

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and then
I gotta know you now and then

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again 
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now
We may never meet againPretty baby you are the soul, snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me 
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Very close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just let me get next to you

So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky, how I worry 'bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love

So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again
Baby won't you come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you 
And get a release from this awful misery

What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore
Not like before, can't you understand me
Don't you understand me, now baby please
Pull yourself together, do it very soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet

Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land 

Maybe there we can find
A good place to keep a lovin' state of mind
I'm so tired of being without it
And never knew what love was all about
James Moody would you come on hit me, 
You can blow now if you want to, I'm throughYou been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am

You always wanna talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role

Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay,
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do. Are you gay?

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

He said, 
I said, 
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script

I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than meThan what I feel for you
No sweeter song, no heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song than what you sing, sing to me

Ooh, you're the sweetest thing
That I've ever known
And to think that you are mine
You are mine alone

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for youWhile you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro red

So now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah

And although my pride is not easy to disturb
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With you battered jeans and your beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me

And although he is nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to blugdeon my futile tears
And I'm not used to this, I observe, I don't chase
So now I'm stuck with consequences thrust in my face, yeah

And the melodramas of my day deliver blows
That surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be, yeah

And although my pride's not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With you battered jeans, yeah, and your beastie's tee
Now I can't work like this with you next to me

His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down I'll get it off my mind
Oh, it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks, yeah
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks

And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you get my number down and such
But I've never hated myself for my age so much, yeah

And although my pride's not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with you battered jeans, and your beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me, yeah

And although my pride's not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah, and your beastie tee


Her name is Cherry, we've just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me after eighteen years
And you still don't see me like you ought to do

Maybe we could talk 'bout things 
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to turn you down

You're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back, you stubborn as a mule

Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitarA beautiful thing
Taking you away
My head is spinning)

My girl
Tried to stop me
But I had
A taste of you
Unfamiliar
Surroundings
Left me wanting
Something new
Physical
Ain't even my type
But you're one
Of a kind
So subconsciously
On purpose
I left my coat behind

I can't help it
Need to stop it
All that I put
Myself through
Everyone
Is so denying
Yeah
It's nice
To meet you, too

I hate
My alcoholic logic
As I write
This on the train
Victoria's Secret
In my bag
And my thighs
Ache again
Last night tips
Into my mind
Through the puddle
In my head
I always get
What I want
I think I even said

I can't help it
Need to stop it
All that I put
Myself through
Everyone
Is so denying
Yeah
It's nice
To meet you, too

Although I enjoyed it
I should have tied up
My loose ends
But I left my jacket
With you
And you know my friends
So maybe
You will get my number
Or ask them
When I'm ached down
But I may have
Forgotten you
By the next time
I'm in town

I can't help it
Need to stop it
All that I put
Myself through
Everyone
Is so denying
Yeah
It's nice
To meet you, tooYou give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure?
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
And you say that I'm the only one, the only one, yeah
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star?

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of, yeah
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me...In different ways
All the while you will see
My songs of praise
How can I concentrate
When all the while my head
Throw me scenarios
So I tease my self esteem
Though I can talk it through
Really I finally talk
My frustration is released
But nothing let em' know
And added to that I'm sick
Of having to seek some peace
Because I need emotion
With my physical release

Chorus:
Can't help
But bring it up
And beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing
I'm wasting my breath
Can't help
But bring it up
And beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing
I just keep wasting my breath

They everywhere I go
And I always stare
I justify attraction
By your hands
Your lips, your hair
And so although I always look
I know that I can't touch
And because I can only take
A full time man so much
And now I reached a point
Where I don't care anymore
It's a necessity
Just like it was before
Many says I ignore
The way my body aches
'Cause I'm the shit I earn
I can't look for my sins
Oh, oh, no

(Chorus)

Can't help
I can't help
But bring it up, no
But my
Nothing, no
Can't
I can't help, no, no
But my words are for nothing
I just keep wasting my breath

(Chorus)

Can't help
But my
Can't help
But my words are for nothing
I just keep wasting my breathKept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet

Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy

You went back to what you knew
So far removed
From all that we went through

And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...
I go back to us

I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow and I love puff

And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny
Rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

Black, black, black, black
Black, black, black
I go back to
I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to blackBut already she knows me better than you
She understands me
After eighteen years
And you still don't see me
Like you ought to do
Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to tune you down
You're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back
You're stubborn as a mule
Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitarSo surely I would never, ever go through it first hand
Emulate all the shit my mother hates
I can't help but demonstrate my Freudian fate

My alibi for taking your guy
History repeats itself, it fails to die
An animal aggression is my downfall
I don't care 'bout what you got, I want it all

It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again, 
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again, 

I'm nurturing, I just wanna do my thing
And I'll take the wrong man as naturally as I sing
And I'll save my tears for uncovering my fears
Our behavioural patterns that stick over the years

'Cause it's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again, 
Now my destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again, 
Ooh, it's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again, "What is it 'bout men? What is it 'bout men?"Than what I feel for you
No sweeter song, no heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song than what you sing, sing to me

Ooh, you're the sweetest thing
That I've ever known
And to think that you are mine
You are mine alone

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you
