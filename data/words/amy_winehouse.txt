But already she knows me better than you
She understands me
After eighteen years
And you still don't see me
Like you ought to do
Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to tune you down
You're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back
You're stubborn as a mule
Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitarRockin' your fuck me pumps
And the men notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to

'Cause you all look the same everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night 'cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer's wife

You don't like players that's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers they don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller

You're more than a fan lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night stands
He could be your whole life if you got past one night
But that part never goes right

In the morning you're vexed he's onto the next
And you didn't even get no text
Don't be too upset if they call you a sket
'Cause like the news everyday you get pressed

You don't like players that's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
Or them big ballers don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller

You can't sit down right 'cause your jeans are too tight
And you're lucky it's ladies' night
With your big empty purse every week it gets worse
At least your breasts cost more than hers

So you did Miami 'cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E, met somebody
And spent the night getting caned

Without girls like you there'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you there's no nightlife
All those men just go home to their wives

Don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump that you'd always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumpsHis hair was exactly the shade of brown
He's just not as tall, but I couldn't tell
It was dark and I was lying down

You are everything, he means nothing to me
I can't even remember his name
Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I came

What do you expect? You left me here alone
I drank so much and needed to touch
Don't overreact, I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely

How can I put it so you understand? 
I didn't let him hold my hand
But he looked like you
I guess he looked like you
No, he wasn't you
But you can still trust me, this ain't infidelity
It's not cheating, you were on my mind
Yes, he looked like you
But I heard love is blindYou need the nerd to hide your ego, don't come with that
You think everything is handed to you free
But it's not that easy, no

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

My girl says I'm too sensitive to run with you
But I'm not listening to her, mmhm
Yes, I'm perceptive, so when I'm done with you 
You'll wish your head back the way it were as you were

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

Oh, I'm not ruling you out
I'm just in doubt as to
What you say you're all about, yeah

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and then
I gotta know you now and then

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again 
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now
We may never meet againPretty baby you are the soul, snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me 
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Very close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just let me get next to you

So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky, how I worry 'bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love

So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again
Baby won't you come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you 
And get a release from this awful misery

What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore
Not like before, can't you understand me
Don't you understand me, now baby please
Pull yourself together, do it very soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet

Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land 

Maybe there we can find
A good place to keep a lovin' state of mind
I'm so tired of being without it
And never knew what love was all about
James Moody would you come on hit me, 
You can blow now if you want to, I'm throughYou been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am

You always wanna talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role

Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay,
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do. Are you gay?

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

He said, 
I said, 
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script

I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than meThan what I feel for you
No sweeter song, no heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song than what you sing, sing to me

Ooh, you're the sweetest thing
That I've ever known
And to think that you are mine
You are mine alone

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for youWhile you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro red

So now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah

And although my pride is not easy to disturb
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With you battered jeans and your beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me

And although he is nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to blugdeon my futile tears
And I'm not used to this, I observe, I don't chase
So now I'm stuck with consequences thrust in my face, yeah

And the melodramas of my day deliver blows
That surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be, yeah

And although my pride's not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With you battered jeans, yeah, and your beastie's tee
Now I can't work like this with you next to me

His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down I'll get it off my mind
Oh, it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks, yeah
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks

And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you get my number down and such
But I've never hated myself for my age so much, yeah

And although my pride's not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with you battered jeans, and your beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me, yeah

And although my pride's not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah, and your beastie tee


Her name is Cherry, we've just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me after eighteen years
And you still don't see me like you ought to do

Maybe we could talk 'bout things 
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to turn you down

You're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back, you stubborn as a mule

Maybe we could talk 'bout things

You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitar
