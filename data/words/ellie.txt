And you fit like a glove
That is no way to live
That is no way to love
Full of fear in your skin
And the weakness in giving in

You're stabbed in the back
But you feel no pain
Push the heaviest doors
That you can't open
Yeah, they tied me up
And my body lies still again

You're as bright as the sun
And as calm as the moon
I don't know when you'll break
But it's gonna be soon
If my will caves in
I'll be in the same boat as you

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand
"The meaning of"

Hands on strings
And my mouth open
Find the perfect words
That I've not spoken
And I won't tell the truth
Unless you want me to

For all of the times
That I lost my head
When it rolled to the floor
And I found it again
But when it came back
No, I didn't know my own name

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand
"The meaning of"

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand
"The meaning of"

The meaningI'm just a victim of the weapon in my hand
So many casualties of love
But I've been bulletproof
I'm staring at the sun!

I was the one you took home
Never a flame to burn slow
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
So many bodies I've touched
Crashing around me like dust
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

I don't need nobody
Need nobody but
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you

I'm just so used to emptiness
Can't feel your heartbeat when I'm lying on your chest
You're different from the ones before
I know you don't believe it's you I've waited for

I was the one you took home
Never a flame to burn slow
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
So many bodies I've touched
Crashing around me like dust
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

I don't need nobody
Need nobody but
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you

But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

I don't need nobody
Need nobody but
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but youAnyway far from here
Wanting home tonight
Feeling the cold fear

I don't speak as you do
I don't even know who I am (Who am I?)
My hands are getting colder
Your temper's gettin' older

Where are you going to?
Are you trying to take off it?
My heart is always searching
But you're not climbing

Carry up to me (Escalante)
Hold the air I breathe (Escalante)
What you say you said? (Escalante)
A steep mountain
And your stones were stained with my poison
Escalante

The whole shit is coming back from me
A fingerprint decayed with hate
If you love me, you should show me
How to reconsider what I did

Take me again, again and again
To the place where there's no dark
I can't steal your sight again
But I can kill you in the dark

Carry up to me (Escalante)
Hold the air I breathe (Escalante)
What you say you said? (Escalante)
A steep mountain
And your stones were stained with my poison
Escalante

Carry up to me (Escalante)
Hold the air I breathe (Escalante)
What you say you said? (Escalante)
A steep mountain
And your stones were stained with my poison
Again and again
Carry up to me (know you know it)
Hold me, hold me (I'm feeling empty)
What do we have done (breaking the relief)
A steep mountain, and you know I love it
EscalanteAnd the cherry sky
Under blossom clouds
Though it's late July
You don't even try
Still you look so cool
Like a cover boy when you light the moon

Need the countryside
But I just forgot
All the things that matter
I forget a lot
I get so caught up
In the city crowd
But this place is still my first love

Is there anybody out there
Waiting for me on my way
If that somebody is you
Then baby I just want to say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

Guess I need to run
Take me to the bus
But don't let me go
No, don't let me on
Got to hold me tight
Won't put up a fight
Of course I'll stay
I'll stay the night

Is there anybody out there
Waiting for me on my way
If that somebody is you
Then baby I just want to say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

We're at the lost and found
We're at the lost and found

Is there anybody out there
Waiting for me on my way
If that somebody is you
Then baby I just want to say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

We're at the lost and found
We're at the lost and foundShouldn't need a riddle to unlock your heart
So, say what's on your mind
We got other things that we could do with our
Time, we could rule the world
Know you say you never need another girl
But, you're not making sense
Trying to keep it moving while you're on the fence

Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes

It's a mystery
I know that something happened in your history
Oh, it's too much to risk
You give me some, but you've been holding most of it
Back, so it's no surprise
Everything you do, I over analyze
Breathe, in and out
Baby, give me something new to think about

Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes

Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codesWe've only ever touched
When there's no one else around
I can be elusive if you want me to
I'm not being intrusive
I just wish I knew the truth

As to why 
I wait for you
Longer than the average person would
And why
I think about you 
More than I think one should

Our body's fit together like a makeshift puzzle
And It's clear to see why you puzzle me
when you turn your frame
And you whisper my name
As though I am a burden

And I know
and I know
this will happen again and again
so don't let us pretend that this is the end
this is the end
this is the end

I am at your house
So I belong to you for now
Trying to impress you 
But lord I don't know how
I can be a statue if you want me to
I'm not being difficult I just need to know the truth

As to why
I'm wanting you
And I would take you away if I could
And why I'm still here
It's something I still haven't understood

Our hands press together like pieces of paper
But they're always blank when I hold your hand
And it gave you a fright
When I stayed the night
Cus you gave yourself to me

And I'm making up for last time
And I'm making up for you
And I'm waking up from last night
And I'm waking up with you
So what's new
So what's new
So what's new

Our hands press together like pieces of paper
But they're always blank when I hold your hand
And it gave you a fright
When I stayed the night
Cus you gave yourself to me

And I'm making up for last time
And I'm making up for you
And I'm waking up from last night
And I'm waking up with you
So what's new
So what's new
So what's new
So what's newEvery day it seems your life is up and down
And you say that you're looking for an answer
Everywhere you look it seems it can't be found

Like searching, trying to find the rainbow
No one's ever found it, yet it's told to be
But if you're looking for a lover
Everything you need, yeah, you can find right here with me

I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul

Now you've been trapped by love
Someone takes your heart and then says goodbye
So you say that you'll never love another
Tired of playing games and that's the reason why

But now whenever were together
There's a certain feeling that we both agree
And it's time that you've opened up to love
'Cause if you don't ever try, then baby, you may never see

I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul

Together you and I were meant to be
I'll be right beside you whenever you need me
This love you have will never fade away
You can count on me 'cause I'm here to stay

I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soulRunning through the woods, running through this shots
Tryna to survive a day!
All I want is that you extend your hand to me
Singing outside waiting for the words to come
Living my life tryna do what's right,
And hope for a better day
You know those words you wrote me brought me to my knees
All I'm saying is that

You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, to be alone
You're home, hope you find your way home

Singing outside waiting for the world to call
Living my life tryna do what's right
In the hope of a better day
And all I want is that you extend your hand to me
Oooh, I want show me where it hurts,
We'll make it OK
Tell me that you'll stay
Even when I'm far away
My voice will carry through
Until the end it's me & you
We can make it if we try
All that I'm saying is that

You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, to be alone
You're home, hope you find your way home

You're never gonna be aloneFeeling this way for you
There's something in the way you move
Something in the way you move
With you I'm never healing
It's heartache through and through
There's something in the way you move
Don't know what it is you do

Not one bone in your body good enough for me
But this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve
When our eyes meet I can only see the end
But tonight I'm here yours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what're you waiting for?

Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh

There's an evil night air
The stars don't shine tonight
Something in the way you do
Something in the way you

Push me closer, further
Break me just enough
Your lies always seem so true
There's nothing left for me to lose

There's not one thing I can do to change your ways
But I can't sit back and take the lonely days
When our eyes meet I can only see the end
And tonight the rain pours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what're you waiting for?

Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what're you waiting for?

Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
OhBut you know what you are here for
Close your eyes
Lay yourself beside me
Hold tide for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone we don't need attention

Open your hand 
Take a glass
Don't be scared 
I'm right here
Even though you don't roll
Trust me boy 
You wanna be high for this

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Take it off
You want it off
Cause I know what you're feeling
It's ok
Boy I feel it too
Let it be 
Baby, breathe
I swear I'm right here
We'll be good
I promise we'll be so good

Oh, open your hand 
Take a glass
Don't be scared 
I'm right here
Even though you don't roll
Trust me boy 
You wanna be high for this

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-ohIn the back of a car with you, I stare into the sun
Still not too old to die young
But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
Way, way, way, way
(And then you take it all away)
Way, way, way, way

Place a kiss on my cheekbone
Then you vanish me, I'm buried in the snow
But something tells me I'm not alone

But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
Way, way, way, way
(And then you take it all away)
Way, way, way, way

So lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything
So lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away

I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
Way, way, way, way
(And then you take it all away)
Way, way, way, wayI think I know what you're trying to say
Honey, it's fair play
Why try to win when I know I've lost?
We don't have to spell it
I think I know what you're trying to say
Just because I think this could break me
It doesn't mean that it will at all

Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you, babe
Do what you have to

What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me

Let's call it a day, babe
I think I know what you're trying to say
And honey you're so right
There's so much to lose, but so much to learn
Let's call it a maybe
But we both know you're already gone
And just because it feels like I'm breaking
It doesn't mean I will fall apart

Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you, babe
Do what you have to

What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me

Love to you, babe

It's good for meChosen specially for you and I
Who will live inside

The mountaineers gathered tinder piled high 
In which to take along
Driving many miles, knowing they'd get here 

When they got here, all exhausted 
On the roof leaks they got started 
And now when the rain comes, we can be thankful 

Ooh, ah, ooh
When the mountaineers saw that everything fit
They were glad, and so they took off

Thought we were due
For a change or two
Around this place

When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay with 

The village used to be all one really needs 
Now it's filled with hundreds and hundreds of chemicals
That mostly surround you 
You wish to flee, but it's not like you 
So listen to me, listen to me 

Oh, oh, and when the morning comes
We will step outside 
We will not find another man in sight
We like the newness, the newness of all 
That has grown in our garden soaking for so long 

Whenever I was a child
I wondered what if my name had changed
Into something more productive like Roscoe 
Been born in 1891 
Waiting with my Aunt Rosaline 

Thought we were due
For a change or two 
Around this place

When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay with 

Oh

1891
They roamed around and foraged
They made their house from cedars
They made their house from stone

Oh, they're a little like you
And they're a little like me
We have all we need

Thought we were due
For a change or two 
Around this place 
This place, this place

When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay with
When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay withMakes my heartbeat like a drum
See the panic in my eyes
Kiss me, hold me when I cry
'Cause you always want what you're running from
And you know this is more than you can take

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh, your touch so bittersweet
Aahhh, ah aaha
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us

Your cheek is softly by the sun
Makes my heartbeat like a drum
I know it hurts you
I know it burns you
Hot and cold in a lonely hotel room
Look into me, tell me why you're crying
I need to know

'Cause you always want what you're running from
And it's always been that way
Oh

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh, your touch so bittersweet
Aahhh, ah aaha
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us

'Cause you always want what you're running from

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh, your touch so bittersweet
Aahhh, ah aaha
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks usAnd I gave in
I lacked the things you need the most, you said
Where have you been?

You wasted all that sweetness to run and hide
I wonder why
I remind you of the days you poured your heart into
But you never tried

I've fallen from grace
Took a blow to my face
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost

Explosions
On the day you wake up needing somebody
And you've learned it's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same
It will never be the same

You left my soul bleeding in the dark
So you could be king, ah
The words you said are still untold to me
And I've lost my faith in everything

The nights you could cope, your intentions were gold
But the mountains will shake
I need to know I can still make...

Explosions
On the day you wake up needing somebody
And you've learned it's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same

And as the floods move in
And your body starts to sink
I was the last thing on your mind
I know you better than you think
'Cause it's simple, darling
I gave you a warning
Now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces
So watch them fall with you in slow-motion
I pray that you'll find peace of mind
And I'll find you another time

I'll love you another time

Explosions
On the day you wake up needing somebody
And you've learned it's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the sameLet it all fall out, open your mouth
Often I lie wide awake, think of things I can make
But I don't seem to have the parts to build them

Human, I wonder why you're a better make
Than I could ever build or create, you know not love or hate
I am so scared of what will kill me in the end
For I am not prepared, I hope I will get the chance

To be someone, to be human 
Look what we've done, look what we've done

I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)

Human, I'm trying to come clean, I will be a better me
I will not drink until I'm dead, I'll make the most of it
I don't know what it's like to be alive, to say goodbye
To cry a thousand times because my ears won't listen

Human, I'm trying not to lose my faith in you
I've sussed out all that I've seen through, I've sailed an ocean
I am so scared of what I'll look like in the end
For I am not prepared, I hope I will get the chance

To be someone, to be human
Look what we've done, look what we've done

I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)

I used to hear it all so loud, the sound of my heart breaking
The truth is waiting to be found, I trust that I will take it 

I would give my life
I would give my life (Human)
I would give my life (Human)
I would give my life (Human)

I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)Makes my body ache and I'm ready
To fall into the sky
I see now
The reason why

Yeah
Yeah

This feeling is heavy
Makes my body ache and I'm ready
To fall into the sky
I see now
The reason why
My heart is heavy
Takes me to a place I can't breathe
Only then I know why I see
The warning sign

This feeling is heavy
Makes my body ache and I'm ready
To fall into the sky
I see now
The reason why

This feeling is heavy
Makes my body ache and I'm ready
To fall into the sky
I see now
The reason why
My heart is heavy
Takes me to a place I can't breathe
Only then I know why I see
The warning signSooner or later I'll be on my own
June into summer, I'll wear out my shoes
Tune into someone, got nothing to lose

Without your love I'm getting somewhere

Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere

Move in the sun till I burn all my ties
Hay fever scratching and watery eyes
I think I've been waiting for this all my life
Coldest dark kisses left frozen in timeHit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning

Handle bars, and then I let go, let go for anyone
Take me in, and throw out my heart and get a new one
Next thing, we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes

So we burst into colors, colors and carousels
Fall head first, like paper planes and playground games
Next thing, we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes

Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching

Hit me with lightning

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goesKnow your bullets fly through the night
Broken doors falling, and hotel floors 
I was never yours, never mine

All I said was "Hello, hello"
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time
And all I said was "Hello, hello"
Tell me how to say "goodbye", cause it's goodbye

I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it die

See change whispers in the waves
Watch my sorrows drown peacefully
And empires crumble to the shores
I was never yours, never mine

All I said was "Hello, hello"
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time
And all I said was "Hello, hello"
Tell me how to say "goodbye", cause it's goodbye

I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it die

I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it die
I can't stay on my knees (on my knees)
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die (it's alright)
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it dieWith a spinning head I lie and watch you smoke
Change the hands on my watch and hold you close
This misery is weightless as a stone

Have you lost the same things I have lost?
Do you know the panic I know?
And would I see the terror in your face?
Do you know that fever I know?
I wish time was still we'd stay right here
With time to kill in our hearts without chains
And if time was still we'd have no fear
Or scars to heal in our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chains

You left everything behind except yourself
And all I see is question marks and nothing else
You must've landed in New York by now
Please don't bring this love down

Have you lost the same things I have lost?
Do you know the panic I know?
And would I see the terror in your face?
Do you know that fever I know?
I wish time was still we'd stay right here
With time to kill in our hearts without chains
And if time was still we'd have no fear
Or scars to heal in our hearts without chains
In a house without chains

Don't bring this love down
Don't bring this love down
Don't bring this love down
Don't bring this love down

I wish time was still we'd stay right here
With time to kill in our hearts without chains
And if time was still we'd have no fear
Or scars to heal in our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chainsPart of you, bittersweet
But now you tell me lies
Up and down, cold and hot
Swear to God, got to stop
Because I can't sleep at night
If you wanted love like this
Blowing up with every kiss
Should've known better

Because you find yourself alone
Chilling you right to the bone
No, should've known better

You and me just
Running towards the light
Giving up the fight
Hoping we survive

You and me just
Strangers in the night
Giving up the fight
Waiting to ignite

Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life

Lost in you, lost in me
Afraid of love, in too deep
So we just run and hide

Lightening fast, felt the crash
Scared to lose, fear attacks
We only know goodbye

You and me just
Running towards the light
Giving up the fight
Hoping we survive

You and me just
Strangers in the night
Giving up the fight
Waiting to ignite

Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life

If you wanted love like this
Blowing up with every kiss
Should've known better

Then you find yourself alone
Chilling you right to the bone
No, should've known better

Hopelessly holding on
To all those perfect nights
Let's pretend it's not gone
And say we'll never die

You and me just
Running towards the light
Giving up the fight
Hoping we survive

You and me just
Strangers in the night
Giving up the fight
Waiting to ignite

Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life

Hopelessly holding on
To all those perfect nights
Let's pretend it's not gone
And say we'll never die
Say we'll never dieCover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over

Yes, since we found out
Since we found out

That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

After the war we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its colour

But now I've seen it through
And now I know the truth

Baby, I'll give you everything you need
I'll give you everything you need, oh
I'll give you everything you need
But I don't think I need you

Stripped to the waist
We fall into the river
Cover your eyes
So you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath
To see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year
I knew the panic was over

Yet since we found out
Since we found out
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
Oh, whoa

But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need youDo I get the best of your love
Even when our bodies are drunk
Is it me you're stumbling from
Forget the words that you said
With your fingers spell out my name
Take away the sky in our breath
Remember love is a game, love is a game

Don't break, don't fade
While we're not real, we're never too late
Make time, it won't hurt
Said I'll go now, but you said it first

I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste

In the midst I'm seeing your face
And I can't believe this is fake
Blow the blossom into your room
As you throw me in disarray
There's a button that I need to press
There's a face that I need to kiss
Come on, give me your heart and your head
Make you conscious never resist, never resist

Don't break, don't fade
While we're not real, we're never too late
Make time, it won't hurt
Said I'll go now, but you said it first

I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste

I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertasteWe hold our heads up high tonight
And we breathe the smoke ethereal
We let our hearts subside tonight

But it marks the skin 'cause I know I've sinned
And it plagues the air on my house movin'
There's a sound out here in the darkest woods
And I know my own fears are understood

It's a ritual and I know you feel it
It's a ritual and I know you've seen it
It's a ritual and I know you feel it
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it

We jump into the devil's shoes
It's far too late to be rescued
From high we see some thundered skies
We see our faith, you hear our cries, it comes

And it won't stop here, echo in my ear
There's a raging fire and it burns so near
But I'm ready now, but I'm ready now

The ritual, we lose it allRunning from the truth because the truth's too much to take
I keep raising glasses because I only got today
I just keep moving, I just keep moving

You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
Happy, in rain or thunder
Baby I keep
I keep on, I keep on, I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing

Can you see my, see my headlights
You can come ride shotgun with me
Whatever you like, ever you like
Every time I look at those stars
Know they ain't got the answers for me
But I'll be alright, I'll be alright

You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
Happy, in rain or thunder
Baby I keep
I keep on, I keep on, I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing

I just keep on dancing
(Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing)

You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
I just keep on dancing
(Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing)
I just keep on dancing
(Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing)
I just keep on dancingAnd you were someone else
I'd say so much to you
And I would tell the truth

'Cause I can hardly breathe
When your hands let go of me
The ice is thinning out
And my feat brace themselves

I'm there in the water
Still looking for ya
I'm there in the water
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

You've seen this all before
Life left on the shore
We're smiling all the same
You sail away again

Oh, yeah
I'm dead in the water (I'm dead in the water)
Still looking for ya (Still looking for ya)
I'm dead in the water (I'm dead in the water)
Can't you see? (Can't you see?)
Can't you see?I would’ve listened to my brother when he spoke to me
And I never would’ve played with my conscience
In the fields where I was in their company

But you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I used them on my youth
And you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, and I won’t lose them

Now I found my feet
Count to one, two, three
And I’m taking off tonight, now I’m free
As I walk my feet on the cold concrete
And I, and I, and I

I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city, eh eh eh

I wandered down the streets with my new town
With the lights blinding and my heart weighed down
I think I'll get a job receiving people's thunder
For the folks back home, I will make them proud

But you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I used them on my youth
Yeah, you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I don't wanna lose them
I don't wanna lose them

I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city, eh eh eh

Shoulders ache for want of wings
My city shakes the fear in me

I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city, eh eh ehTake another sip
(Don't panic)
Stop checking your phone
Looking for the answers
(Don't panic)
Mind running obsessed
Feeling paralyzed
(Don't panic)
Let me watch you undress
Fall into the night

Yeah we change and we change and we feel so lost
And we don't know who we are
Yeah we break and we break and we just can't stop,
So we just keep breaking hearts

Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can we take it back to the start?
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic

Been shattered before
Everything breaks
(Don't)
I can't really be sure
Of our mistakes
(Don't panic)
Come under my love
Like an umbrella
(Don't panic)
Going to make you feel good
Yeah, better than ever

Yeah we change and we change and we feel so lost
And we don't know who we are
Yeah we break and we break and we just can't stop
So we just keep breaking hearts

Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can we take it back to the start
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic

I got big dreams, baby
I got big dreams, baby
So don't you overcomplicate it
I got big dreams, baby
I got big dreams, baby
So don't you, don't you overcomplicate it

Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can we take it back to the start
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic
Don't panic
Don't panicWho are we to play with hearts and throw away it all?
Who are we to turn each others heads?
Who are we to find ourselves in other people’s beds?

I don't like the way I never listen to myself
I feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help
Oh, I don't think you want me much at all

This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
I'm feeling down about this love

Who are you to make me feel so good?
Who are we to tell ourselves that we're misunderstood?
Who am I to say I'm always yours?
Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores?

I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart
Now we're falling on each other like we're always in the dark
Oh, I don't think you know me much at all, all, all, at all

This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall

This love is not what you want
This heart will never be yours
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfallI do what I love and I love what I do

How many times do I need to
Need to fight you baby
Just to get that it's no good

And I know that I'm strong
But my mind's almost gone
And it's getting on my mood
And all this buzzing you been doing
See you got me hanging up
See you really got me worse

But I got to move on baby
Because bitches got to eat
Got to get back to work

Something's calling us
We're breaking free
I'm curious I need to see
Like a flash before our eyes we'll leap toward the night
And if it feels like we're dreaming
Believe it, believe it (Yeah)

We don't have to wait till the morning
The sun will never go down (Yeah)
What we'll do it wait forever
We gotta take it now (Yeah)
So stay awake, stay awake
You can stay with us till paradise
So stay awake, stay awake

Hand in hand side by side
While our reflections flicker bodies collide
So full of energy nothing to hide
No need to sleep we come alive
And if we're gonna take this ride we can go wherever we like
And if it feels like we're dreaming
Believe it, believe it (Yeah)

We don't have to wait till the morning
The sun will never go down (Yeah)
What we'll do it wait forever

So stay awake, stay awake
You can stay with us till paradise
So stay awake, stay awakeI'll take you to the ocean, I'll bring the sun
We are 17, we have just begun
I have loved to fight for and then some
You are the one, the one, the one, the one
The one, the one, the one, the one

Wake up in the morning, we're paralyzed
We'll fly into the garden like butterflies
There will be no blood and there'll be no pain
I want to fall in love with you again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal, an animal, an animal

I'll tie you in my arms, I will smother you
We'll tell each other lies, I will tell the truth
I'll colour in the sky, and I'll colour you
I want to join your skin again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal, an animal

We will run away from danger
We will run away
I-I-I-I-I, I will have to fight for...

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal, an animalLike a last breath you would breathe
You were like home to me
I don't recognize this street

Please don't close your eyes
Don't know where to look without them
Outside the cars speed by
I've never heard them until now

I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it
You were just saving yourself when you hide it

Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin
And I know you care

I used to run down the stairs
To the door and I thought you were there
To shape to the comfort of us
Two lovers locked out of love

Oh, but I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it
You were just saving yourself when you hide it

Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin

I know it wasn't always wrong
But I've never known a winter so cold
Now I don't warm my hands in your coat
But I still hope
'Cause this is how things ought to have been

And I know the worst of it
Wasn't all that it seemed
Why can't I dream, why can't I dream?
'Cause I know you care

And I know you care
I know you care, I know you care
I know it's always been thereMm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

Only you can be
The aching in my heart, my enemy
The only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive

Only you

Only you can see 
The emptiness I feel when you're with me

Only you can be
The aching in my heart, my enemy
The only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive

Only youI look in the mirror

I can't get over you
Is it someone?
Is it someone else?
Is it someone else?

I look in the mirror
And I try to see myself
My head full of terror
From the games I played so well
I try to see clearer
I try to forget the fires I started
I try to be nearer
To where you are
To where you are

Are we star crossed lovers?
Did I really want you gone?
If I'm really a winner
Where did these demons come from?

I was the girl who was on fire
I was the girl who was on fire
Only a bird could get much higher
(I look in the mirror)
'Cause I was the girl who was on fire

I look in the mirror
And I try to understand
And piece it together
Watch the blood from both my hands
I can't see the ending
There are people who know my every secret
I'm tired of pretending
You're in my heart
In my heart

Are we star crossed lovers?
Did I really want you gone?
If I'm really a winner
Where did these demons come from?

I was the girl who was on fire
I was the girl who was on fire
Only a bird could get much higher
(I look in the mirror)
'Cause I was the girl who was on fireI don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down

Next I thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you
You were talking deep, like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

Now I always hear always hear them talking
Talking about a girl, about a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you, but I don't still don't get it
You didn't love me, no not really

Wait, I could've really liked you
I bet, I bet that's why I keep on thinking about you
It's a shame, you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind

You got yourself in a dangerous zone
Because we both had the fear, fear of being alone
And I still don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And my heart don't understand it
Understand it, understand it
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebodyThat true love, it was taken away from us so young
We're summer kids
Without a song, we're fading in to oblivion
But we're still the one

We got our guard up and we're hung up on another loss
I need to summon all these demons keeping me on the floor
But now we're here and I am giving everything to you
Just say you need this, say you need me, say you want this too

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we do

That sadness kills

Don't let the past dictate the way you play it now
Don't play it down
The time is now
I know you're feeling what I feel, just let it show
Don't let it go

Somebody somewhere driving in their car is crying out
Forever running from the truth, sometimes all we have is doubt
But now we're here and I am giving all I can to you
Just say you love me, say you love me, say you want this too

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we do

No one does it like we do
No one does it like we do

Somebody somewhere driving in their car is crying out
Forever running from the truth, sometimes all we have is doubt
But now we're here and I am giving all I can to you
Just say you love me, say you love me, say you want this too

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we do

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we doI feel a lump in my throat
And this is far from joy

I never seem to learn
That high makes things harder
That high I get from you

I've figured out the joy is not in your arms
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart
I think it's time to run 'cause I'm seeing stars
I'm seeing stars watch me fall apart

I think of dying all the time
But I've got joy to take my side
Fear is my favourite

Oh, and then you'll seeI'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene

And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
Hes the only one for me, Jolene

I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
JoleneWhen everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight

I need your love
I need your love

I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart

I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight

I need your love
I need your love

Now I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong
I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong

And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight

I need your love
I need your love

All the years, all the times
You have never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing

And all the tears, all the lies
All the waste
I've been trying to make it change
And now my eyes are open

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be freeWhy when men look outside do they see houses,
Instead of the fields they grew from?
We are constantly uprooted from them, making us tiresome and fearful
Can you get up right now, endeavor to free-fall

'Cause you can fall if you want to 
It's just a matter of how far
You treasured our home town
But you've forgotten where you are
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found
And it has been found wandering around

With that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away
And I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed

Patterns all arranged in my background
These pillars and posts keeping this country on form
Letters were all sent with no addresses
So that people can't discover
We're always undercover
Why do I always draw triangles
Instead of words this paper so deserves?

'Cause you see
I don't own my clothes but I own my mind
And it's not what you've lost
But it's what you find.

You found that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away
And I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed

'Cause you can fall if you want to
It's just a matter of how far
You've treasured our home town
But you've forgotten where you are
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found
And it has been found wandering around

With that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away
And I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayedLike all the boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before,
Like all the boys, boys, boys

You left a blood stain on the floor
You set your sights on him
You left a hand print on the door
Like all the boys before,
Like all the boys before

This is our luck baby, running out
Our clothes were never off
We still have our roads to run about
To scale the map, scale the map,
To get us back on track

I've seen you in a fight you lost,
I've seen you in a fight

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
Your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me

Like all the boys before

In here the world won't bring us down
Our plan is gold dust
Out there a lonely girl could drown
In here we're frozen

Where did the people go?
My hands are empty
You're not the answer I should know
Like all the boys before, like all the boys
Before

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
Your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me

We're in a mess baby,
We're in a mess babe
Your more is less babe
We're in a mess baby,
We're in a mess babe
Your more is less babe

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
And your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
(I've seen you in a fight you lost)
Like all the boys before,
Like all the boys before

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
Our house full of paper,
And your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
Your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing meYou're living in the past it's a new generation
A girl can do what she wants to do and that's
What I'm gonna do
An' I don't give a damn ' bout my bad reputation

Oh no not me
No no no no no
Not me me me me me

An' I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation

An' I don't give a damn
'Bout my bad reputation

Oh no, not me

'Bout my bad reputation

Oh no, not me
Oh no, not
Not me, not meWasn't any war we couldn't win
We had unbreakable powers
When our bodies meet, it's everything
This was a beautiful vision
Even love was not a way you could describe it
And then there comes a collision
Nothing ever goes in the night

And they're not lost forever
Lost what once was here
It's now just sparks
Now the fireworks are fading
Is it over?
Lost you in the summer 

Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago

If there's no storm, why're we a shipwreck?
Thought our love is insurmountable
He knows my heart is still aching
Never thought it would be caused by you

We're not lost forever
Lost what once was here
It's now just  sparks
Now the fireworks are fading
Is it over?
Lost you in the summer 

Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Two years ago
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on

And the reason I can't forget is I think you do too
I know you think of me, too
I'll use this moment to really forget
I will soon, but for now
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you

Two years ago
About you
About you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
About you
About you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Two years ago
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving onSwore upon the sun I'd save you for a rainy day
Loosen the noose then let go of the rope
I know if it's never coming back, it has to go

I keep calling your name (Keep calling your name)
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed
So I keep calling at night (Keep calling at night)
I wanna hold you close, I just never wanna hold you tight

Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms

I've found the weakness and put it to play
Swore upon the stars I'd keep you till the night was day
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know
You said if you're never coming back you have to go

I keep calling your name (Keep calling your name)
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed
So I keep calling at night (Keep calling at night)
I wanna hold you close, I just never wanna hold you tight

Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms

Oh my goodness, here I go again
Pulling you back to me
Pulling you back into my arms so selfishly
I don't think I understand, 'cause I don't really know myself
I keep calling you up, calling you up
Calling you up
Calling you up
Calling you up
(So, I can call)Years of too much thought and time I wasted
And in each line upon my face
Is proof I fought and lived another day

When did life become this place of madness?
Drifting on an empty sea of waves and sadness?
I make believe I'm in control
And dream it wasn't all my fault

When your feet don't touch the ground
When your voice won't make a sound
Here, it's safe
In this place
Up off the clouds
When your feet don't touch the earth
You can't feel the fates that hurt
And you're free
There's no need 
To come down
When your feet don't touch the ground

Everyday just feels a little longer
Why am I the only one not getting stronger?
Running around pretending life's a play
It doesn't make the darkness go away

I may be young but I can still remember
Feeling full of joy, crying tears of laughter
Now all my tears are all cried out
Make-believe, but count me out

'Cause my feet are on the ground
And the inner voice I found
Tells the truth, "There's no use,
if your head's in the clouds"
With my feet on solid earth
I can face the fates that hurt
And in time
I'll be fine
I'll come 'round

I was once like you
Life was a maze
I couldn't find my way out
But what I say is true
You will be amazed
Make-believe and you will find out that it's true

When your feet don't touch the ground
When your voice won't make a sound
Here, it's safe
In this place
Up off the clouds
When your feet don't touch the earth
You can't feel the fates that hurt
And you're free
There's no need 
To come down
When your feet don't touch the groundI had a heart then, but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up the strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone



Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place the only time I feel safe

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone





You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

Home, home


Home, home


Home, home


Home, homeYou know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Every day I feel this pain
But you just turn and walk away

No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong
With you and me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Touch me and then turn away
And put your hands into the flame
Tell me if you feel this pain
'Cause I don't wanna be a ball and chain

No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong






Yeah, give me the respect
Forgive me and forget
I've gotta get a grip
Living on the edge

I barely even know this fuckin' woman in my bed
And if there's too much on my plate, then I ain't finishing my veg
And if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side
Well it ain't, swear on my mother's life
You got me wrapped up in your shit, I'm feeling mummified
I've only had this fuckin' feeling in my stomach twice


(To you and)


You gave me what I needed
And I gave her everything she wanted
There's something about your cleavage
Now I can't put my fingers on it
You're taking me the deepest
I thought she was gonna vomit
If all women from Venus
Then I guess I really got a rocket

You've got a noose around my neck but I'm still hanging on
We've nearly reached the finish line up in our marathon
I spat a verse, she sang a song
She broke my heart I took some Gaviscon


I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me, with you and me, with you andYou're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've gotta find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire

Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Yeah yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do (Ah)
What are you waiting for?And I walked a thousand miles to prove it
And I'm caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts
The colour of my blood is all I see on the rocks
As you sail from me

Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me
My bones will bleach, my flesh will flee
So, help my lifeless frame to breathe

And God knows I'm not dying but I breathe now
And God knows it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew

The lost dreams I buried in my sleep for him
And this was the ecstasy of love forgotten
And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets
And my blood is all I see
As you steal my soul from me

Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me

And God knows I'm not dying but I breathe now
And God knows it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew

And God knows I'm not dying but I breathe now
And God knows it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew

And God knows I'm not dying but I breathe now
And God knows It's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you (I lost with you, I lost with you)
It drowns the love I thought I knew (I thought I knew, I thought I knew)You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything

For what it's worth
For what it's worth
For what it's worth
You were my backbone when my body ached with weariness
You were my hold down when my heart was filled with loneliness
And just as the dark was rising I heard you close the door again
And just as the light turned south I knew who I dream of

Could've given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything

You are my only hope
The truth, the dare, the consequence
I know you don't feel the same you're sensible and it doesn't make sense
I know I'm gonna wait my heart out you know I'm gonna try much harder
But it isn't the shit in my head that's holding me under this time

Could've given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything

You my everything
You my everything
You my everything

You my everything
You my everything
You my everything

Could've given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything
You my everything
You my everythingI was just lonely
I was just in need of a friend
Spend your days
Thinking if only
Thinking if only you and me made sense

For any love
Quit the pain you feel
You won't let it go
You won't let it heal
Baby, it's clear
You don't know me
You don't know me

And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal

It's in your eyes
I can see that you're broken
I know you're lost because I am too
It's in your voice
I hear you choking
When did the illusion take the truth

I think you're in love
With the pain you feel
You won't let it go
You won't let it heal
Baby, it's clear
You don't even know me
You don't even know me

And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal

You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out
It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love you've given now
You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out
It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love you've given now

And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal
Heal
HealWith wounded lips and salted cheeks
And finally we step to leave
To the departure lounge of disbelief
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
And I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine bitter sunlight

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

Before daylight

In the canyon underneath the trees
Behind the dark sky, you looked at me
I fell for you like autumn leaves
Never faded, evergreen
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
'Cause I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine bitter sunlight

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

I can't face this, now everything has changed
I just wanna be by your side
Here's hoping we collide, here's hoping we collide
Here's hoping we collide

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

I wanna hear your beating heart tonightYou never let me give up
All the nights and the fights
And the blood and the breakups
You're always there to call up
I'm a pain, I'm a child, I'm afraid
And yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
I know that we don't look like much
But no one fucks it up like us

16 and you never even judged me
Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me
Sitting there in the caravan
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor
And yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

Dark times, you could always find the bright side
I'm amazed by the things that you would sacrifice
Just to be there for me
How you cringe when you sing out of tune
And yeah it's everything
So don't change a thing
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
(I'll be yours)
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
I'm standing with an army

Yet you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
They don't have a chance either

Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing near you
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
When I'm with you
Standing with an armyWhen I watched you disappear
When you made me stop believing
I could fight away the fear

Now the smoke has cleared and the end is near, it was my illusion
Like a broken dream, I was incomplete
But your love was never the missing piece

I feel like I'm breathing again
I feel like I'm seeing again
I feel like I'm breathing again
I got it under control-ol-ol
I got it under control-ol-ol
I got it under control-ol-ol

All that's real is faded
Like a car into the night
Like a painkiller, I take it
And I watch the world igniteThese haters couldn't get to where I am with a full tank of petrol, uh
My uncle used to drink a can of kestrel when life got stressful, uh
What kinda person should you be when wanna make people accept you, uh
What does it really mean when you dream of being famous and successful,
When you were born to be special,
Uh yeh and I went from the kid in class,
Text some radio DJs so they could bring me up
To the young rapper that everybody's ringing up,
Got em looking for a sprinkle of that pixie dust
Mad thoughts in my head when its blowin up
Like, are you really big enough?
I traded friends for fans
Cement for sand
Raise your hand 
The wonderman

[Ellie Goulding]
See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the wonderman)
I saw the chosen one their calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The wonderman

[Tinie Tempah]
Bored of being nameless
Bored of feeling awkward
When you walk up in the mall and cant afford a pair of trainers,
Imagine when it changes, imagine satisfaction when you make it,
Its more than being famous,
More then the applause and more than any form of status,
More than the performances in 20 foreign places,
Benidorm, Vegas, many more praises,
Amen hallelujah "Tinie look what's happened to ya?"
Yeh they love that attitude brand new and improved, yeh

And when the fans start grabbing you,
Show gratitude with a little brag or two,
Amen, hallelujah Tinie look what's happened to ya,
Who can say they ran all the obstacles I ran, look
I traded friends for fans, 
Cement for sand, 
Raise your hand, 
The wonderman

[Ellie Goulding - Chorus]
See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the wonderman)
I saw the chosen one their calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The wonderman

Come on come on the stars are where you belong
Come on come on follow your heart is gunna take you home
Come on come on the stars are where you belong
There's no turning back from here

See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the wonderman)
I saw the chosen one their calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The wondermanLie next to your frame, girl unobserved
You change your position and you're changing me
Casting these shadows where they shouldn't be

We're interrupted by the heat of the sun
Trying to prevent what's already begun
You're just a body, I can smell your skin
And when I feel it, you're wearing thin

But I've got a plan

Why don't you be the artist
And make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer
And decide the words I say?

Because I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it’s too hard to ask
Won't you try to help me?

Sat on your sofa, it's all broken springs
This isn't the place for those violin strings
I try out a smile and I aim it at you
You must have missed it, you always do

But I've got a plan

Why don't you be the artist
And make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer
And decide the words I say?

Because I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it’s too hard to ask
Won't you try to help me?

You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted
You wait, I wait, casting shadows

Why don't you be the artist
And make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer
And decide the words I say?

Because I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it’s too hard to ask
Won't you try to help me?

Why don't you be the artist
And make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer
And decide the words I say?

Because I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it’s too hard to ask
Won't you try to help me?A silent heart ticking under the ground
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found
If you hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after all

A silent heart ticking under the ground
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found
If you hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after all

A silent heart ticking under the ground
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found
If you hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after all

A silent heart ticking under the ground
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found
If you hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after allIt starts with a picture and it sits in your frame
And we part with a letter and it ends in my name
And it starts with forever and it ends with a touch
And I know that you're clever and I don't ask for much



Maybe we forgot all the things we are
When we are together



You said I'm arresting, you said I had heat
I really thought that we'd go further the second time we meet
'Cause I'm tired of trying to keep you - all I want to do is sleep
And perhaps when I'm sleeping you'll get back on your feet



Maybe we forgot all the thing we are
When we are together

Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest
It's not so hard every time you go





I run out to meet you when I knew the storm had come
And I felt the rain on your face and the damage you had done
I know what you're thinking - it will never be the end
And when the storm is over, you won't see me again



Didn't know the price I'd paid for all the times I stayed
When we were together

Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest
It's not so hard

()
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
()
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
()
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
Or maybe we forgot

Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest

Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest
It's not so hard every time you goI need a helping hand, just to beat the void
I need a mission, a dream to stop me talking to myself
And now the silence is broken, now my soul is to sell
I need to pick up the pieces, to scatter to the wind
Hold the city to your ears, you can hear the waves come in

You can't change the world with a song
And you can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me
Wherever I go, it's playing for you
I can't stop this voice unravelling 'round of me
Whatever I do, it's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart
Beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me, believe, believe, believe me

Don't let it slip through your fingertips
When there's a ghost, don't try to reason with it
'Cause now I'm tired, I'm wired, so I won't miss a thing
I wrote my words up to dry, and I've forgotten what to sing

But you can't change the world with a song
You can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me
Wherever I go, it's playing for you
I can't stop this voice unravelling 'round of me
Whatever I do, it's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart
Beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me, believe, believe, believe me

If that's what it was to you
Then that's what it was to me
If that's what it was to you
Then that's what it was to me
If that's what it was to you
Then that's what it was to me

But you can't change the world with a song
You can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me
Wherever I go, it's playing for you
I can't stop this voice unravelling 'round of me
Whatever I do, it's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart
Beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me

Believe, believe, believe me
Believe, believe, believe meIf you never said anything?
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never said anything?

If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never

Here it is in my hands
In my veins and over lands
It spreads like fire, seeking air
To pull me in my own fanfare

Won't you come, won't you come
Won't you come, just don't say a word
Won't you come, won't you come
Won't you come, just don't say a word

If you never, if you never
Just don't say a word
If you never, if you never
Just don't say a word

I'm more alive than I've ever been
So, now I give you all my sins
Chosen you, I've chosen you
But don't say a word

And if I save us and I fall down
I will leave your words behind now
If you never held me under
If you never hear my thunderThis love is like fire and ice
This love is like rain and blue skies
This love is like sun on the rise
This love got me rolling the dice
Don't let me lose
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

Beautiful mind
Your heart got a story with mine
Your heart got me hurting at times
Your heart gave me new kind of highs
Your heart got me feeling so fine
So what to do
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

It took us a while
With every breath a new day
With love on the line
We've had our share of mistakes
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for you

Brighter than gold
This love shining brighter than gold
This love is like letters in bold
This love is like out of control
This love is never growing old
You make it new
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

It took us a while
Because we were young and unsure
With love on the line
What if we both would need more
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for you

Falling, crash into my arms
Love you like this
Like a first kiss
Never let go
Falling, crash into my arms
Never breaking what we got
Still falling for you
Still falling for...

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
All for me

And just like that
All I feel is you
All I feel is you
You are all for me
I'm still falling...
And just like that
All I feel is you
All I feel is you
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for youBite chunks out of me
You're a shark and I'm swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed
Now your friends come sniffing

Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go, my love, it's very late
Till morning comes, let's tessellate

Go alone my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones alone, my lover
And keep us on my heart

Three guns and one goes off
One's empty, one's not quick enough
One burn, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins

Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning, they'll nosh you up
Yes, they'll nosh the love away, but it's fair to say
You will still haunt me

Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go, my love, it's very late
Till morning comes

Wild green stones alone my lover
Keep us on my heartWhen you played the thief and I played the fool
Gonna make you move, make you move, make you move
Been so long crying over you
Now I'm coming your way
Gonna make you move, gonna make you move, make you move, make you move

Chasing faces in the sand
Now your dagger is in my hand
I'll make you move, I'll make you move, I'll make you move

I'll make you run faster, faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way 'cause I can't lose
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way
I'm coming through

I'll make you run fa-, I'll make you run fa-
I'll make you run fa-, I'll make you run fa-

Coming down on you with a flashing light
There's nowhere to run maybe you can't hide
Gonna make you move, make you move, make you move

It's too late now the tables turned
There's no going back and you'll never learn
Unless I make you move, I make you move, I make you move

And you think I'm still broken hearted
But you'll never win the war you started
You'd better open your eyes

Faster , faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way 'cause I can't lose
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster

Get out of my way, get out of my way

And you think I'm still broken hearted
But you'll never win the war you started
You'd better open your eyes

I'll make you run
I'll make you run
I'll make you run
I'll make you run

Fears overplayed
Two left feet emergency. 

Wide open space 
Catch my tail, 
fishing net. 
Fold up my frown 
take the rage 
and smooth it out. 

Stick to my skin, 
paper mache face to live in. 
Same view to paint, 
Watercolour your name 

Face your mistakes 
(You will never have to feel that way again) 
Oil your chains, under rate. 
(You will never have to feel that way again) 
Read every page, 
Press the dents, fighter plane 

I held the fort, and I swung my sword I have muted the screams I have broken the falls oh I have fought, and I swung my sword I have muted the screams I have broken the falls 

Fighter Plane 
Fly away!Show the bruises on your skin
Let the fires all burn out
I can hear the silent shout in you

Let it go don't be so scared
Find the love you lost again
Let the chaos disappear
Don't you know I'm always here for you

Cause this is devotion
I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion
I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
Cause this is devotion

Tell me what you dream about
I lose you in my sleep, somehow
Let the chaos disappear
Don't you know I'm always there for you

Cause this is devotion
I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion
I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
Cause this is devotion

Cause this is devotion
I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion
I am caught
Floating in your gravity

Cause this is devotion
I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion
I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
Cause this is devotionBecause over pain love is outgrown
I've never won a fight to understand
I just move as my heart commands

I've always had a thing for silence
But lately I just need a voice I recognise
Baby, it's perfect timing now to

Scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
So scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down

Have you found peace with your mistakes
Breathing on the glass as it breaks?
Have you found the words to save her
And keep your heart out of danger?

I don't think I can take the violence
And lately I just need a voice I recognise
Baby, it's perfect timing now to

Scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
So scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down

I've always had a thing for silence
But lately I just need a voice I recognise
Baby, it's perfect timing now to

Scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
So scream it out, out
I won't let you down, downI'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
See I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world

If I was a sculptor, but then again no
Or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the worldFeels unused
I've never met anyone like you

Frightening
Feeling naked
Sensing, searching something sacred

I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll look for you, baby

Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

Go
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

I'm exhausted with loving
No fight in me, I'm defeated
I know I'm fooled, I can't help it
You make my heart so helpless

I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll look for you
For you, maybeYou drove me off the road

But you let go 'cause your hope is gone
And every question fades away

It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time to hear you heart's false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
Well, you know this is your biggest mistake

You tread water
Fighting for the air in your lungs
Move, move closer
Maybe you can right all your wrongs

But you let go 'cause your hope is gone
And every answer fades away

It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time to hear your heart's false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
Well, you know this is your biggest mistake

Wipe the mud stains from the face, stop the engine
Yeah, stop pretending
Wipe the mud spray from your face, stop the engine
Yeah, stop pretending that you're still breathing

It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time to hear your heart's false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
Well, you know this is your biggest mistake

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
You know this is your biggest mistakeAs long as stars are above you
And longer if I can

How long will I need you?
As long as the seasons need to
Follow their plan

How long will I be with you?
As long as the sea is bound to
Wash up on the sand

How long will I want you?
As long as you want me to
And longer by far

How long will I hold you?
As long as your father told you
As long as you can

How long will I give to you?
As long as I live through you
However long you say

How long will I love you?
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I may

How long will I love you?
As long as stars are above youTread floors you don't fall through 
Make waves, you crash a cymbal hard 
Follow no one, always play the wrong card
 
Waste days, in foreign places 
Shed light, on your better side 
Reassure me that you'll wait for me
Wait for me as long as it takes 

And I'll hold my breath, I'll hold my breath 

Until you see me in your dreams 
We'll stay awake beneath the trees 
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust 
A sky of diamonds just for us
You are the risk I'll always take 
The only branch I'll never break 
Those fears, we'll blow them all way 
We'll blow them all away 

Fight fires in your best clothes 
Touch skin with your eyes closed 
Chase thunder, with the volume down 
Pack a suitcase, wander to the next town 

Force quit, on your losing streak 
Solve a riddle in a magazine, be tongue in cheek 
Tell me that we're still too young
That we're still too young and I'll hold my tongue 

Until you see me in your dreams 
We'll stay awake beneath the trees 
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust 
A sky of diamonds just for us 
You are the risk I'll always take 
The only branch I'll never break 
Those fears, we'll blow them all way 
We'll blow them all away 

I'm here, I'm here to take you 
I'll swim, I will swim to save you 
No fall, I'm here to catch you 
I'll swim, I will swim to save you 

Until you see me in your dreams 
We'll stay awake beneath the trees 
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust 
A sky of diamonds just for us 
You are the risk I'll always take 
The only branch I'll never break 
Those fears, we'll blow them all way 
We'll blow them all awayIf you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out

Me out

I'm living on the wild side
I've never seen a footprint
In the land of rivers
You're my only bridge
And I feel the fear in me
And I don't wanna fall asleep
When I turn into someone else
I know that it can't be beat

If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock 
If you lock
If you lock 
If you lock 
If you lock me

Will you know I am?
(If you lock me)
Will you know you are?
(If you lock me)
Will you know I am?
(If you lock me)
Will you know you are?

I think I've been praying
The lights won't go out
My body's getting colder
As I follow this road down

If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold on)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold on)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the ending)Into me push it deep
Wash the dirt, a hard day's work, know my place

On my own
No poison in my bones
On my own
This is where I build my home

My home
This will always be my home
This will always be my home

I work until it's late
Walk in and closed the gate
I look in the window and gaze at my face

Every line and every abrasion
This took my life to make
This took my life to make

On my own
No poison in my bones
On my own
This is where I build my home

My home
My home

I need someone to hold
I need someone to hold

My home
This will always be my home
This will always be my homeYou left me with your open hands
I never knew what I had to do

Stumbling out in the dark
You left me with a question mark
You said the bridges had to be burned

And it's a pain that only we know
Oh and you lost all on your own
Always has to be a new scare
To keep us falling over the edge

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
Because you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise

There's a place we try to reach
Impossible as it would seem
I heard you crying out in your sleep

I see that look you save for me
I pull you back upon your feet
I know you always need something more, more

And it's a thing that only we know
Oh and you lost all on your own
Always has to be a new scare
To keep us falling over the edge

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
Because you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise, paradise
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise

I know we're headed for a moment, baby
We made sense of it
I know I struck you so reckless, honey
We gave into it
(Paradise)

I know we're headed for a moment, baby
We made sense of it
(Paradise)
I know I struck you so reckless, honey
We gave in

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
Because you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise, paradise,
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise.Who are we to play with hearts? 
And throw away it all 
Who are we to turn each others heads? 
Who are we to find ourselves in other people's beds? 
I don't like the way I never listen to myself 
I feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help 

I don't think you know me much at all 

This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 
I'm feeling down about this love 

Who are you to make me feel so good? 
Who are we to tell ourselves that we're misunderstood? 
Oh who am I to say I'm always yours 
Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores 
I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart 
Now we're falling on each other like we're always in the dark 

I don't think you warned me much at all 

This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 

This love is not what you want 
This heart will never be yours 
This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 

This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 

You're so quiet 
But it doesn't faze me 
You're on time 
You move so fast 
Makes me feel lazy 

And let's join forces 
We've got our guns and horses 
I know you've been burnt 
But every fire is a lesson learnt 

I left my house 
Left my clothes 
Door wide open 
Heaven knows 
You're so worth it, you are 

But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you 
I would, I would, I would, I would, I would 

Let’s tie words 
'Cause they amount to nothing 
Play it down 
Pretend you can't take what you've found 
But you found me 
On a screen you sit at permanently 

I left my house 
Left my clothes 
Door wide open 
Heaven knows 
You're so worth it, you are 

But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you 
I would, I would, I would, I would 

It's time to come clean and make sense of everything 
It's time that we found out who we are 
'Cause when I'm standing here in the dark 
I see your face in every star 

But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you 
I would, I would, I would, I would, I would 

I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you 

I had a way then 
Losing it all on my own 
I had a heart then 
But the queen has been overthrown 
And I'm not sleeping now 
The dark is too hard to beat 
And I'm not keeping up 
The strength I need to push me 

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 

Noises, I play within my head 
Touch my own skin 
And hope they'll still be there 
And I think back to when 
My brother and my sister slept 
In another place 
The only time I feel safe 

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 

Lights, lights
Lights, lights

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 

Home, home 
(Lights, lights, lights)... 

You're as sharp as a knife and you fit like a glove 
That is no way to live that is no way to love 
Full of fear in your skin and the weakness in giving in 

Stabbed in the back but you feel no pain 
Push the heaviest doors that you can't open 
Yeah they tied me up and my body lies still, again 

You're as bright as the sun and as bold as the moon 
I don't know when you'll break but it's gonna be soon 
If my will caves in, I'll be in the same boat as you 

I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 

He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
Created just to understand
"The meaning of" 

Hands on strings and my mouth open 
Find the perfect words that I've not spoken 
And I won't tell the truth unless you want me to 

For all of the times that I lost my head 
When it rolled to the floor and I found it again 
But when it came back, 
I didn't know my own name 

I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 

He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
Created just to understand
"The meaning of" 

I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 

He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
Created just to understand 

I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 

He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
created just to understand... 
"the meaning of" 

Oh, oh, starry eyed 
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning 

Handle bars 
That I let go, let go 
For anyone 
Take me in 
And I'll throw out my heart 
And get a new one 

Next thing, we're touching 
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning 

Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And everybody glows 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And my body goes 

So we burst 
Into colours 
Colours 
And carousels 
Fall head first 
Like paper planes and playground games 

Next thing, we're touching 
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning 

Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And everybody glows 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And my body goes

Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys

You left your blood stain on the floor 
You set your sights on him 
You left a hand print on the door, 
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before (boys boys boys boys) 

This is our luck, baby, running out 
Her clothes were never off 
We still have hours to run about 
To scale the map, scale the map, to get us back on track 
I've seen you in a fight you lost, I’ve seen you in a fii-ii-ii-ii-ght 

Were under the sheets and you're killing me 
In our house made of paper, your words all over me 
Were under the sheets and you’re killin me 

Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys

In here the world won’t bring us down 
Our plan is golden 
Out there a lonely girl could drown 
In here were frozen 

Where did the people go? 
My hands are empty 
You're not the answer I should know 
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before 
(whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,) 

Were in a mess baby, were in a mess babe 
Your more is less babe (oh, oh) 
Were in a mess baby, were in a mess babe 
Your more is less babe (oh, oh!) 

Were under the sheets and you're killin me 
In our house made of paper, and you're words all over me 
We're under the sheets and you’re killin' me 
(I've seen you in a fight you lost) 
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before 
Were under the sheets and your killing me 
Our house full of paper and you're words all over me 
Were under the sheets and you’re killing me 
(Oh you’re killin me, your killin me!!) 

Were under the sheets and you're killing me 
In our house made of paper, your words all over me 
Were under the sheets and you’re killin me 
(killin me, killin me, killin me) 
Killin me, killin me, killin me 

Oh, oh, starry eyed 
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning 

Handle bars 
That I let go, let go 
For anyone 
Take me in

And get a new one

I see you're sorry how I'm burning down the gun
With a war in your mind that never wants to be won
I catch you in a light no one else can see
I know you see her, and you'll never see me
She makes you feel the most, keep your souls alive
But what we had, it never really died

And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth
But here's to us, here's to us, here's to us

Yeah, this is just a phase, pretty sure of that
And one day, you and I, we will never look back
You kept me in the flames but the fire was out, the fire was out

And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth

Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh

And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth
But here's to us, here's to us, here's to usBaby I worked this out for sure
It's gonna be colder
Now you've forced open the door
I know you better
Than I ever have before
I know you

I know you're a fighter
But you never fought for me
When I was a shelter
But you're not heading home to me
We could be closer
We could be closer
We could be

When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

It's gonna be (It's gonna be better)
And it's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, oh, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better

We'll take a long walk
Down the alleys of these houses
And we'll talk
See what conversation rouses
When we're alone
When we're alone
It could be home

When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

It's gonna be (It's gonna be better)
And it's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, oh, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be better

It's gonna be (It's gonna be better)
And it's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, oh, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be betterWe don't have to worry about nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something

Girl in the world...But it doesn't faze me
You're on dial
You move so fast, makes me feel lazy

Let's join forces
We've got our guns and horses
I know you've been burned
But every fire is a lesson learned

I left my house
Left my clothes
Door wide open, heaven knows
That you're so worth it, you are

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Then maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you, I would

Let's type words
Because they amount to nothing
Play it down
Pretend you can't take what you found
But you found me
On a screen you sit at permanently

I left my house
Left my clothes
Door wide open, heaven knows
You're so worth it, you are

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you, I would

It's time to come clean,
And make sense of everything
It's time that we found out who we are
'Cause when I'm standing here in the dark
I see your face in every star

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you, I would
I'd do it all for youI wouldn't even flinch
I couldn't try to move
My mind is on you
My mind is on you

If the street lights smashed above me
I wouldn't move an inch
Turn the glass into stars
And your face is the moon

And the night turns to you
'Cause my mind is on you

You got me caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what
I can take anything
I can take anything
I can take anything

If electric charges shock me
I'd smile and fold my arms
I'd feel nothing new
Because my mind is on you
Ooh, my mind is on you
Ooh...

And if the floor gave way to my shoes
I wouldn't try to fly
I can't explain why
I always feel
Always feel you
I always feel
Always feel you

You got me caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what
I can take anything

You're the heat in my bones
Would you break my with stones?
You're the heat in my bones
But you break my with your stones

If a plane crashed into my room
I wouldn't even flinch
I couldn't try to move
My mind is always on you
My mind is always on you

Caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what

Even when I'm caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what
I can take anythingIs that too much to ask
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask

When I look into your eyes
Boy, I'm feeling delirious
But you know this is serious
I'm sticking to you like glue
Only see you now and then, but I know we could have it all
Because before I was cynical, baby you were just cool

I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong
I could be, I could be, I could be there
If only you'd let me in, I could be there
Just tell me where and tell me when
So tired of these roads going nowhere
But I know your love takes me somewhere

Still looking up and down while you're being mysterious
I see really big things for us
We just need to break through, break through, break through
Everything that you say, god I wish I had said it first
And forgetting I had ever hurt
Your love is pulling me through, me through, me through

I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong

You are all I want
So take me home
The more you been thinking about us
Open up, don't let me go
The more you been thinking about

I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong
I could be there
If only you'd let me in, I could be there
Just tell me where and tell me when
So tired of these roads going nowhere
But I know your love takes me somewhereLips like Tanqueray
Tropical sunrises, never sleeping
I don't know what changed

All I want to do is feel the rhythm of the night
You've been running from the dark
You can't look me in the eyes
Being called into the heat
Even if it's burning me
I just need to dance without you

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
You're not in love

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss

Through the streets and all the places I've been
I can see we never had harmony
I won't go even though I'm alone and I know I want out

I go up without you bringing me down
Such a rush
So now I'm staying to dance on my own
On my own
And all I know is

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
You're not in love

We don't even kiss
I'm not in love
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
You're not in love

Now I'm giving you up tonight
Now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because
We can't move together

Now I'm giving you up tonight
Now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because
We can't move together

Now I'm giving you up tonight
Now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because
We can't move together

Now I'm giving you up tonight
Now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because
We can't move to

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
And all I know is

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
I'm not in love
