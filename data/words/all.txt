Right, right here, I stay...

Stand tall 'til it fades...

Shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
I said, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet 
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, shoot me again, shoot me
Shoot me again, shoot me again
Come on, shoot me again, shoot me again, shoot me

All the shots I take...
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take, I spit back at you, oh-oh-ohh

I won't go away...

Right, right here, I stay...
(With a bullet in my back!)

Shoot me  {Take a shot}

I'm stranded and sold...
(With a bullet in my back!)

No compromise, my heart won't pump the other way

Wake the sleeping giant, wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog, no, let him sleep 
Wake the sleeping giant, wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog, no, let him sleep

I bite my tongue, tryin' not to shoot back

All the shots!  All the shots!
All the shots I take...
Hey, what difference did I make?
Yeah, all the shots I take, spit back at you, oh-oh-ohhDrifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel

Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
GoodbyeNo one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant till I fall

Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away

Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man

Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see, the slaughter never ends

Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away

Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man

Why am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here

Why am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying

Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, moulded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend, alone I clench my gun

Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away

Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man, back to the front

Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the frontUniverse much too big to see
Time and space, never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitation of human understanding

Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive, yeah-h'eah!

(Twisting, turning, through the never)
All that is, ever... Ever was... Will be, ever,
Twisting, turning, through the never!

In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies
Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
On a quest: Meaning... Reason...
Came to be... How it begun

All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun, yeah-h'eah-h'eah!

(Twisting, turning, through the never)
All that is, ever... Ever was... Will be, ever,
Twisting, turning, through the never!

(On through the never)
We must go  (On through the never)
Out to the  (Edge of forever)
We must go  (On through the never)
The never comes!

(Twisting, turning, through the never)
All that is, ever... Ever was... Will be, ever,
Twisting, turning...
Who we are, ask forever
Twisting, turning, through the never!
Never!Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel

Not the word
Not the love
Not what you thought from above

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed!

Find your peace
Find your say
Find the smooth road on your way

Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed!

Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed!

Follow the god that failed!
Broken is the promise
Betrayal, betrayal, yeah!You don't actually care
You don't actually care
Love for you is no beginning
You're not really there
Hallucination

I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination

I understand you think you're above it
The adolescent sense of the sky
The feeling of billowing heartbeats
The fingertips run through your hair

They run through your hair
Hallucination
Hallucination

Oh, you think you're so special
That there's no law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are
We're mere mortals below
Fingertips run through your hair
We are mere mortals below

Are meant to be peons
Are meant to be servants
Are meant to be dismissible objects
One fucks with
One fucks with

Poor pitiful creature

The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every minuscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy

An idiot's idiocy
My, my caring for you
Caring for you
Do you think we're a book
Some kind of a table
You can rest your feet on when you're able
Red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
Poor pitiful creature

To notice the pining
The self deprivation
The self flagellation of you
Dear worshipers
We do like you regal
We do like you haughty
We do love to look upon your perfect body

The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
The taste of your vulva and everything on it
We all really love you
And you have no meaning
You don't even see us
You were never caring

You go do what you do
You do it for you
No one exists with you
You're way above caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Thinking of you
Is another way of dying
Is another way of dying

I'm clawing your chest
Till your collarbone bleeds
Piercing your nipples till I bite them off
I scratch your face and bite your shoulders
Way above caring
Way above caring
And your Kotex jukebox
Your Kotex jukebox

I'm doomed, I'm swearing
Waiting for you
In your high heels and nightie
Your leather dress squeaking
Latex now sweating, waiting for you
In your tincture
Your opium white bathrobe
Your white tiles run red now
Are we both dead now?

The liquid exchange of our heart
The liquid exchange of our heart
Are we both dead now?

You're way above caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring
My caring for you
My caring for you
You're way beyond caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy

My caring for you
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Because thinking of you
Is another way of dying

You're way above caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
You poor pitiful creature
The mistake of feeling
The one who rejects you is the winner
It's true

The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every minuscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
Your heart on your fuckin' sleeve
My caring for you
We were meant to be peons
We're meant to be peons
Mere mortals below
Meant to be servants

Meant to be dismissible objects one fucks with
Oh oh oh, you're so special
No law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are

The fingertips run through your hair
A billowing heart beats
Feeling
Feeling
What a glorious feeling
To be so rejected
So rejected

An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
You think I'm a book or a table
You can rest your fuckin' feet on
When you're able

The taste of your vulva, everything on it
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
We do love you, to look upon your perfect body
We love you regal
We love you haughty
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Caring

Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oblivious to caring

Are we really dead now?
Are we both dead now?The words are cutting deep inside my brain
Thunder burning, quickly burning
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane yeah

Raven black is on my track
He shows me how to neutralize the knife
Show to me in surgery
The art of fighting words to conquer life, conquer life, yeah

Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for
Love me till the end of time, yeah yeah
She make me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mine

I am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime

I've lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child that never was conceived

You gotta believe me
Hey, I'm talking to you

Well, I know, it's hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
More when it's time to die

Don't believe the life you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on, ha ha

Whoa, feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love

Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for

Oh ooh, she makes me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mine
She's all mine, yeah
Yo, yeahNo one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "Rage"

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out againSaid, don't tread on me!

"Liberty or death!",
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke Her:
Rattling of Her tail

Never begins it
Never, but once engaged:
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage!
Said, don't tread on me!

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it!  Settle the score!
Touch me again, for the words that- 
-you will hear ever more:  "Don't tread on me!"

Love it or leave it!
She, with the deadly bite
Quick as the blue tongue,
Forked as a lighting strike

Shining with brightness
Always on surveillance
(Eyes that never close)  Emblem of vigilance!
H'ooh, no-no-no'oh... So don't tread on me!

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it!  Settle the score!
Touch me again, for the words that- 
-you will hear ever more:  "Don't tread on me!"

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war...
"Liberty or death!",
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke Her:
Rattling of Her tail

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it!  Settle the score!
Touch me again, for the words that- 
-you will hear ever more:  "Don't tread on me!"

*(Yes, "Her" is supposed to be capitalized. Do not change.)One crown born to lose
One man does not give a damn
One man, no excuse

Aces wild
Aces high
All the aces
Aces till you die

White lines fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to win

One fist hammers through the mist
One fist, steady on
One heart, die hard from the start
One heart beats its song

Murder all
Murder one
Gimme murder
Second class to none

Headlights fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to win

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
No excuse

Till the end
Been living to win
Been living to winPut dignity to shame, dishonor
Witch hunt, modern day, determining decay
The blatant disarray, disfigure
The public eyes' disgrace, defying common place
Unending paper chase, unending
Deafening, painstaking
Reckoning, this vertigo it doth bring

Shortest straw, challenge liberty
Downed by law, live in infamy
Rub you raw, witch hunt riding through
Shortest straw, this shortest straw has been pulled for you

Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

The accusations fly, discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die, intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you, its teeth and talons through
You're living catch-22, deluding
A mass hysteria, a megalomania
Reveal dementia, reveal
Secretly, silently
Certainly in vertigo you will be

Shortest straw, challenge liberty
Downed by law, live in infamy
Rub you raw, witch hunt riding through
Shortest straw, this shortest straw has been pulled for you

Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

Shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

Behind you, hands are tied, your being, ostracized
Your Hell is multiplied, upending
The fallout has begun, oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none to nothing
You're reaching your nadir, your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear, defending
Channels red, one word said
Blacklisted with vertigo make you dead

Shortest straw, challenge liberty
Downed by law, live in infamy
Rub you raw, witch hunt riding through
Shortest straw, this shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for youI'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"

Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings

"Master, master"

Master, master
Master, master

Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
Promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear and see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"Oh poor twisted me
I feast on sympathy
I chew on suffer
I chew on agony

And swallow whole the pain
Oh it's too good to be
All this misery
Is just for oh poor twisted me
Poor twisted me

Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator, dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

Dear mother, dear father
Time has frozen still, what's left to be
Hear nothing, say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Dear mother, dear father
You clipped my wings before I learnt to fly
Unspoiled, unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do

Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

I'm in Hell without you
Cannot cope without you too
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim, please rescue me

Dear mother, dear father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething, I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite, I feel for you
Living out this Hell you always knew

YouPop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed in the silence

Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless

Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral

Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
A delusion absolution

Perjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Oh, tell the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Burn

Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won't do, that fistful will

Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction

Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction

So light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Oh, no excuse
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Addicted to the
FameCome, won't you stay
Sincere, sincere
All ends in tears

Endure, endure
Thoughts most impure
Concede, concede
But both shall we bleed

Oh, halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell

I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire

Allure, allure
Sweetness obscure
Abide, abide
Secrets inside

Deprive, deprive
To feel so alive
Obey, obey
Just don't turn away

Oh, halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell

I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire

Prayers cannot get through
Return to sender
Unto which of you
Shall I surrender?

Twisting in disguise
Dark resurrection
Lighting up the skies
Wicked perfection

Too dark to sleep, can't slip away
Open or close, my eyes betray
Beyond the black, come, won't you stay?

Hello darkness, say goodbye
Hello darkness, say goodbye
Hello darkness, say goodbyeGrab this life and walk away
War is never done
Rub the patch and battle on
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life
The war that never ends

Leave the battlefield
Yet its horrors never heal
Coming home from war
Pieces don't fit anymore
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life
The war that never ends

Father, please come home
Shell shocked all I've known
Father, please come home

Label him a deadwood soldier now
Cast away and left to roam
Rapid is the road to sacrifice
Just takes longer to come home, come home

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
Crossfire ricochets inside me
Trapped in a memory forever
My life
The war that never endsI know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end

To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity

Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way

Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you

Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight

Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way

See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground

Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way

Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own waySenseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia

Chained and shadowed to be left behind
Nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
Iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metalization of your inner soul
Twisting and turning

Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia

We are as one as we all are the same
Fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
Protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
With our heavy metal

Come let yourself go

Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Eyes tell of morbid tales of his black heart
His deeds through ages past tell of his part

See his face
See his smile
Time to die
Oh, whoa, no

Angel from below, change my dreams
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns

See his face
See his smile
Time to die
Whoa, no, no

I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die

See his face, see his smile
Time to dieCurses rest on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All eternity

Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Hold the pose, feign perception
Grudges break your back

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardized in ruin
What have you become?

Blame the world and blame your maker
Wish 'em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down

Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles
All alone, the fear shall humble
Swallow all your pride

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatine
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead

Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not

Before you judge me take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand

It's not who you are, it's who you know
Others lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and built them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not

(yeah! who the hell are you?)

Holier than thou
You are

It's my world now, it's my world now
It's my world, it's my world

Mama, why's it raining in my room?
Cheer up boy, clouds will move on soon
Heavy fog got me lost inside
I'm gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride

It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world

I'm out my head, out of my head
Get 'em out my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

Who's in charge of my head today?
Dancin' devil's in angel's way

It's my time now, it's my time now
It's my time, yeah it's my time

Look out motherfuckers, here I come
I'm gonna make my head my home
The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead

It's my world, you can't have it

Enough's enoughMoaning at the bed side
Moaning from each limb

Little dog who can't get in
Can only cry but
Can not swim

Pony legs, little trot
Little dog has to wait a lot

The bigger dog has got his spot
And elbowed him away

Listen to him barking
Listen to him call
Little dog don't have much at all

A puny body and a tiny dick
A little dog can make you sick

If you got the money you can go to the top
The female dog don't care what you got
As long as you can raise that
Little dogie face to a cold-hearted pussy
You could have a taste

A taste of what the big dog got
A taste of what the big dog got
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot
Can run his tongue over the hot in trot
Hot in trot
Run his tongue over the hot in trot

Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Tell me what you want

My small dog, he want what I got

Wants to run his tongue over my hot spot

Pathetic little dogDark deception kills the light

Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great old one, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness you dwell

Crawling chaos underground
Cult has summoned twisted sound

Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep has been upset
He awakens, hunter of the shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness you dwell

In madness you dwell

Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons, death may die

Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great old one, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness you dwellWhen I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski
In the dark of the moon

It made me dream of Nosferatu
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau
Oh, wouldn't it be lovely



I was thinking Peter Lorre when things got pretty gory
As I crossed to the Brandenburg Gate

I was feeling snappy, perhaps I'd been napping
And I'd just ate


A following heart can tear you apart
On a midnight to eight shift

A graveyard romance can only give one chance
As the tombstones weave and breathe


Feeling happy when my heart got beating
On a Sunday afternoon

I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses
And stars were still illumined


I have three hearts that I keep apart
Trying to relate
To normal feelings and the nighttime reelings
And some absinthe drunk so late

My small town girl
I'm just a small town girl


The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk
Onto the size of dessert plates

But me I'm happy 'cause I got my little nappy
And some opium to set me straight


I'm just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl
While my looks still hold me straight

Straight up to illusion and fantasy's fusion
Of reality mixed with drink


I'm just a small town girl who's gonna give life a whirl
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate
I'm just a 
Small town girl, she was like a whirl


The Brandenburg Gate
I'm just a small town girl
Small town girl


I'm just a small town girlWeak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery

Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery

Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery

Battery
Battery
BatteryBetter just stay down
You pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the ground
Mouths so full of lies
Tend to block your eyes
Just keep them closed, keep prayin', just keep waitin'

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comes

Push you 'cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself, crawl in yourself, you'll have your time
God, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day, I'll splatter color on this gray

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison

I suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear: The sun will shine
This I swear
This I swear
This I swearTainted misery
Bleed, battle scars
Chemical affinity

Reign, legacy
Innocence corrode
Stain, rot away
Catatonic overload

Choke, asphyxia
Snuff reality
Scorch, kill the light
Incinerate celebrity

Reaper, butchery
Karma amputee
Bloodline redefined
Death contagious deity

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
You burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind
You've reached the end of the line

Time, choke the clock
Steal another day
Die faithfully
Narcissistic fade away

Twisted, jump the rail
Shatter the crowd below
Breaker, chase the ghost
From latest high to all-time low

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
You burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind
You've reached the end of the line

Drop the hourglass of time
Spilling sand we will not find
As we gather here today
We bid farewell
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
Yeah

The slave becomes the master
Need more and more
Right now and ever after
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burned through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind

Dead hourglass of time
Sand we will not ever find
We gather here today
Say goodbye
'Cause you've reached the end of the line

The end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line

You've reached the end of the lineIt looks different, so different than what you see
Projecting judgment on the world
This house is clean baby
This house is clean

Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Look out my window and see it's gone wrong
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector, projector
Rejector, infector, injector, defector, rejector 

I see my reflection in the window
This window clean inside, dirty on the out
I'm looking different than me
This house is clean baby
This house is clean

Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
I look out my window and see it's gone wrong
The court is in session and I slam my gavel down

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector, projector
Rejector, infector, injector, defector, rejector, detector

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector, projector
Rejector, infector, injector, defector, rejector

I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throne
I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throneOil on the wheel
That is blasted and busted away

A nail or a little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
Swarming like bees over the air
Off the pump off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away

Like bees over the air
Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away

Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away

If I pump blood in the sunshine
And you wear a leather box with azaleas
And I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart

As I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin

Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart

If I'm pumping blood
Like a common state worker
If I waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Would you think less of me

And my coagulating heart

Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Coagulating heart
Pumping blood

Would you top me off
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy
While you yell out, "mercy"
We grow apart
Would you rip and cut me

Use a knife on me

Be shocked at the boldness
The coldness of this little heart
Tied up in leather
Would you take the measure
Of the blood that I pump
In the manic confusion of love

Supreme violation
Supreme violation
"Oh, ah, ah, ah Jack I beseech you"

"Oh Jack I beseech you"
Supreme violation

Blood in the foyer
The bathroom
The tea room
The kitchen, with her knives splayed

I will swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick

Blood spurting from me
"Oh Jack, Jack I beseech:"
"Jack, I beseech you, I beseech:"
In the end it was an ordinary heart

"Oh Jack I beseech you"
As I scream out my pain
In the end it was an ordinary heart

In the end, in the end, in the end
It was an ordinary heart

"Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"
Supreme violation . . . Oh

"Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"
I call out your name

Blood in the foyer, the bathroom,
The tea room, the kitchen
And knives splayed
I swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick
Blood spurting from me
Blood spurting from me

"Oh Jack"

"Oh Jack, I beseech ya"
In the end it was an ordinary heart

In the end it was an ordinary heart
Pumping blood.Blacks the light
Blacks the sound
Fear the thought of it never ever coming back
Leave the shift to the round

Death Is Not The End!

Not the End
Not the End
It's the begining

Death is not the end!Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face that learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite

Like a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like conviction, a premonition
Not worthy of, so I deny, I deny

I blind my eyes and try and force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went, almost like your life

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river, drowning, when I only need a drink
Like a poison that I swallow
But I want the world to die

Like a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past, I prayed to leave, from way back then
Like a general without a mission
Until the war will start again, start again

I blind my eyes and try and force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went, almost like your life

Like a touch from Hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from Heaven, turns that key
And brings you straight down to your knees

Like a touch from Hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from Heaven, to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your knees

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went, almost like your life

That was just your lifeCrawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Fear thy name: Extermination
Desecrate, inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still

Fear thy name: Annihilation
Desolate, inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
My apocalypse
Go

Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body, mannequin
Spilling blood, bleeding gas

Mangle flesh, snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass

Split apart
Split apart
Split apart
Spit
Spit it out

What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over?
Born to repeat until I feel

See through the skin, the bones they all rattle
Future and past, they disagree
Flesh falls away, the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me
See the end in me

Claustrophobic
Climb out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Violate, annihilate
All wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate
As life itself denied

Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny inhale the fire

But we've crossed that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Tyrant awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypseMirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave

Like twisted vines that grow
Hide and swallow mansions whole
Dim the light of an already faded primadonna

Faith of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait, something must be done for hundred years

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Now, let my people go, land of Goshen
Go, I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood, running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague, darkness three days long, hail to fire

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first-born man
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first-born man

I rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born, I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Blood, lambs blood painted door, I shall pass

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping deathSaint Anger 'round my neck

He never gets respect

Fuck it all, and no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
I need a voice to let myself, to let myself go free
Fuck it all, and fucking no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
Put down the noose, I'll hang myself
Saint Anger 'round my neck

I feel my world shake like an earthquake
It's hard to see clear: Is it me? Is it fear?

I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you

And I want my anger to be healthy
And I want my anger just for me
And I need my anger not to control

That we should see the light

When reaper calls
May it be
That we walk straight and right

When doubt returns
May it be
That faith shall permeate our scars

When we're seduced
Then may it be
That we not deviate our cause

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

When all is pain
May it be
It's all we've ever known

When flame consumes
May it be
It warms our dying bones

When loss has won
May it be
It's you I'm madly fighting for

When Kingdom comes
May it be
We walk right through that open door

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live, we can live forever

Return to ashes, shed this skin
Beyond the black, we rise again
We shall live foreverYesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the fire

Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, not this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the sky

Unchain the colours before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the fire

Fire
Fire
Fire
FIRE!!Once you have seen it, you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it is heavy and dirty and mean

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know, whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once, so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others, the same song and dance

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath awayTake me with you
Tell me, does your sun still shine?
Come squeeze the world 
Then drip it down my throat again
Down my throat again, oh-whoa

You got to breathe, man, breathe
Coming up for...
Breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for...
Air

Touch me so I think I'm here
Skin my senses
Barely breathing, minus human
Please squeeze the world 
And drip it down my throat again
Ooh, down my throat again

Whoa, oh...
You've got to breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for air
Breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for...
Air

You've got to breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for air
Breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up forAll I want is some special care
On the run from some institution
All I want is some constellation

And I can tell by your face
I'm a total disgrace
Put me inside this place
Move over for a damage case

Hey baby, wait a minute, stop
Don't run away, don't call a cop
I ain't lookin' to victimize you
All I want to do is tantalize you

I can tell by your face
I'm all over the place
I can tell by your face
Got no time for a damage case

No time, baby

Hey babe,don't turn away
I'm here tomorrow, gone today
I don't know what you think your game is
I don't care if even what your name is

And I can tell by this face
You're all over the place
I can tell by your face
Move over for a damage case

Get the fuck over, manHere I go now
Here I go into new days
Hey, hey, hey
Here I go now
Here I go into new days

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah hey hey hey hey hey
Here I go into new days

Hey, hey, hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me
Hey, hey, hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah, hey, hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Hey, hey, hey
And I went
And I went on down that road
Hey, hey, hey
And I went on
And I went on down that road

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
And I went on
And I went on down that road

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear



Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappearConstant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tollsThe window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms, no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
Someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Can't you hear your babies crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still, they try and break me

Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now deservingly this easy chair
But the rocking's stopped by wheels of despair

Don't want your hate
But the fist I've made
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me
While I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Can't you hear your names?
Can't you hear your babies crying?

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try
Mama, they try

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try
Mama, they tryOoh yeah, baby, h'oh-h'oh...
Oh, what was these words right here...
When I get you in my guts...
It makes me play, way too fuckin' good, yeah...

[Battery:]

Lashing out the action - Returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me - Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression - Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery - Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me... Battery... Battery

Crushing all deceivers - Mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me - Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression - Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery - Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me... Battery... Battery

Circle of Destruction - Hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the Battery

You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honey

Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey

If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honey

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb

If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long

If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heart breaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start

And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like hell, the River Styx
Your affection never sticks

No matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honey.If I was half drowning
An arm above the last wave

Would you come to me
Would you pull me up
Would the effort really hurt you
Is it unfair to ask you
To help pull me up

The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating

Pull me up
Would you be my lord and savior
Pull me up by my hair
Now would you kiss me, on my lips

Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening now
Shoots out its tiresome message

Won't you pull me up
Scalding, my dead father
Has the motor and he's driving towards
An island of lost souls

Sunny, a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness
No social redeeming kindness
Or - oh, state of grace

Would you pull me up
Would you drop the mental bullet
Would you pull me by the arm up
Would you still kiss my lips
Hiccup, the dream is over
Get the coffee, turn the lights on
Say hello to junior dad
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
Psychic savagery

The greatest disappointment
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad.Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You...you're smothered in tragedy
And you're out to save the world

Misery!
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery!
There's much more to life than what you see
My Friend Of Misery!

You still stood there screaming!
No-one caring about these words you tell
My friend before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You... you'll take it on all yourself
(Remember), Misery loves company

Misery!
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My Friend Of Misery!

Misery!
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My Friend Of Misery
My Friend Of Misery!

You just stood there screaming, oh
My Friend Of Misery!Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before

Been here before, couldn't say I liked it
Do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?

Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could, I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'

It comes alive
It comes alive
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive	
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Been here before
Been here before

I'm frantic in your soothing arms 
I cannot sleep in this down-filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore

Cross my heart hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon

It comes alive
It comes alive
It comes alive

Takes me awayOoh, no matter where you dwell
You,here again, a captive of the howl
You, welcome back to hell

Faithful as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks angers reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore

Ooh, tooth is fang, twisting under skin
Ooh, foul tongue, black breath
Change, snap inside, the beast about complete
Change, soon infects the rest

Faithful as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks angers reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Howling at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore
Anymore

Ooh,inheritance, the past has bit again
Ooh, the next heir of anarchy
Feel stretching skin so far beyond belief
I feel the ever changing, you, in me

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
Howling evermore
Am I savage?
I don’t recognize me anymore
Anymore

Anymore, ha ha ha
Am I savage?Speak the words I wanna hear to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you

Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining...

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn to stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits
The one who waits for you

Oh, what I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you
(So I dub thee unforgiven....)

Oh, what I've felt...
Oh, what I've known...
I take this key (never free...)
And I bury it (never me...) in you
Because you're unforgiven too

Never free
Never me
'Cause you're unforgiven too

And then produced my rapier

Oh, "Or the Devil, he may take ya."

And it was a pretty penny

Yeah-ehCharging hard and no one's going to give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty

Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct, not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated

Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure

Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated

We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage, Incorporated
Go

Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt

Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy endings on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage, Inc. you see
Step a little closer, if you please

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, IncorporatedNo thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need the feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding
All hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts a-flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse"Suppose," I say...
"You cut some root to make the tree survive."

Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once
I'm, oh, so bored to death!

Ooh, I hunger... I hunger... I eat!

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire,
And run like hell

Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?

"Suppose," I say... "The vultures smile at me."
"Suppose," I say...
"I sent them down and they plan to pick you clean."

And satisfaction, this way, comes
And satisfaction, this way, comes
And satisfaction's here and gone,
Gone, yeah, gone again!

Oh, I hunger... Ooh, I hunger... I eat!

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire,
And stand there

Throw all your bullets in the fire,
And run like hell

On leather steeds, they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen, ride
Or choose your fate and die

'Cause now you've got the fight of your life

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds, they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen, ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeah

Time has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine, your body, it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence, for what you had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death, deliverance, for you, for sure
Now there's nothing you can do

So, gather 'round, young warriors, now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor, blood, guts, and sweat

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

Sleepless, cloaked in despair

Blurring lines of right and wrong

"Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore its done
The brightest flame burns quickest."

A son's heart's sewed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Yeah, still

Rebel, my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what I said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave

So let this heart be still

Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
But a mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
Yeah, I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me, yeah, yeah
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still

Dead gone now

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
There's a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain
I fall 'cause I let go
The net below has rot away
So my eyes seek reality
And my fingers seek my veins

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see 
What I've let me be 
So wicked and worn
So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause Low Man is due

Please forgive me

My eyes seek reality
My fingers feel for faith
Touched clean with a dirty hand
I touch the clean to the waste

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm, yeah
And I can't bear to see 
What I've let me be 
So wicked and worn
So as I write to you, yeah
Of what is done and to do, yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause Low Man is due

Please forgive me
Please forgive me
Please forgive me

So low, the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again
I cry to the alleyway
Confess all to the rain
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror
The one I've broken to match my face

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
Why I've let me be so wicked and wild
So as I write to you, yeah
Of what is done and to do, yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause Low Man is due

Please forgive me
Please forgive me

So low, the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins

(humming)And you will see
Just call my name and I'll be there

You cannot touch me
You would not dare
I am the chill that's in the air

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the day

Dark rivers are flowing
Back into the past
You are the fish for which I cast

And what of the future?
What is to be?
As the rivers flow into the sea

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the day

Do not take for granted
Powers out there
Don't step into the demon's lair

Time is an illusion
Rising from time
Steep is the mountain which we climb

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the dayHave this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

Hard and cold, bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Yeah, are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Yaw, nothing
Oh where's your crown?

Huh!

Wish I may
Wish I might
Have this wish, I wish tonight
I want that star
I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how

Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish you may regret it
Careful what you wish you just might get it

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the King
But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Nothing

No, you're just nothing
Where's your crown King Nothing?
No, you're just nothing
Absolutely nothing
Off to Never-NeverlandOne, two, three, four, five

Spineless from the start
Sucked into the part
Circus comes to town
You play the lead clown

Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Marvel at his tricks
Need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came
Rotting your brain

Chain, chain
Join the endless chain, taken by his glamour
Fame, fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Witchery, weakening
See the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat

Lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lieCrawl out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Ain't no one gonna watch the road
Intention reckless
Ain't no one gonna slow the row
Invention reckless

So I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane

Deadly pulse
Pawing at the wheel
Death Magnetic
Pulling closer still

Ain't no one gonna hold the border
Insanely reckless
Ain't no one gonna give the order
Inanely reckless

So I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane

I scare myself

Crushing metal, Ripping Skin
Tossing body mannequin
Splatter Blood, Bleeding Gas

Mangle flesh, Snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass

What makes me drift a litter bit closer
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over
Dead man takes the steering wheel

See through the skin the bones they all rattle
I start to see the end in me
Flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me

Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Every moment, flashed before my eyes
I wake up SCREAMING
Life is undenied

Ain't no one gonna search the wreckage
Intensely reckless
Ain't no one gonna get the message
Inherently reckless

I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane

Pushing myself in the suicide lane
Daring myself in the suicide lane
Pushing myself in the suicide lane
Daring myself in the suicide laneMotives changing
Day to day
The fire increases
Masks decay

I look at the river
White foam floats down
The body's poisoned
Got to sit tight

The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait

After awakening
The silence grows
The screams subside
Distortion shows

Mutant thoughts
Of bad mouthed news
It's just another birth
Of distorted views

The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait

The wait
The wait
The wait
The waitNo emergency
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face
That learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite

Like a hurt that keeps me focused
Though I think I've gone astray
Like a low grade nightmare that
I must awaken from each day
Like a dream
A beautiful dream
Not worthy of, so I deny...... Yeah

You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
You never open them, so it passed you by
You close your eyes, so you may never fall from grace
You open just in time to say goodbye, oh

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a spring that cannot be in current till
It's time to drink
Like a puzzle
With missing pieces
And the box is thrown away

Like a release from a prison
That you didn't know you're in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed
To leave
From way back then
Like a general
Without a mission
Until the war will start again......

You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
You never open them, so it passed you by
You close your eyes, so you may never fall from grace
You open just in time to say goodbye, oh

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Yeah
Oh, yeah

Oh, yeah

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a touch from heaven on this breeze
That brings you straight down to your knees

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a touch from heaven on this breeze
That brings you straight down to your knees

Oh, yeah

Yeah, yeah

Yeah

Almost like your life

Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life
That was just your lifeThe deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying death pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

The leather armies have prevailed
The phantom lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

Fall to your knees and bow to the phantom lordAll within my hands

Kill, kill, kill, kill, killI've gotta bad reputation
I don't care, I get my share
Don't feel no deprivation

The more I get the better it is
I like it fine, like a little whiz
Treat 'em like ladies, that's a fact
You know the chase is better than the catch

Silver tongued devil, demon leach
You know just what I'm doing
I like a little innocent bitch
You know I ain't just screwing

I love you baby, love you too much
I like you fine I feel your touch
But your appearance don't hold no class
You know the chase is better than the catch

A little beauty I love you madly
Come on home with me
I know you're hot, I know what you've got
You know I want to shake your tree

Come on honey touch me right there
Come on honey don't you get scared
Come on honey let me get you in the sack
You know the chase is better than the catchPlanting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth

Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back what used to be
Drink up, shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain

Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies
Infanticide

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad

Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never Land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never Land
Yeah-heah!

Now I lay me down to sleep

Pray the Lord my soul to keep

If I die before I wake

Pray the Lord my soul to take

And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light

He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath

He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving earth its bleeding
Pure madness alive

And he haunts you
And he binds your soul
And he loathes you
And reclaims it all

You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say

Cthulhu, awaken

He sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyes

Fully loaded Tommy gun

They're gonna put me in a cell
If I can't go to Heaven, let me go to Hell

YeahWhile clutching to what you had thought was real

Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showin' your gratitude
S's'so many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose?

(What the Hell?)  What the Hell?
What is it you think you're gonna' find?

Boredom sets into the boring mind!

(Struggle within!)  It suits you fine!
(Struggle within!)  Your ruin!
(Struggle within!)  You seal your own coffin!
(Struggle within!)  The struggling within!

Home is not a home, it becomes a Hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your Hell

Grabbing for something you've got to feel
(Closing in)  Closing in!
Pressure upon you is so unreal!

I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need

And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay as slave

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will, yeah!

Oh, but I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah!

(And the Earth becomes my throne)
And the Earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one

And my ties are severed clean
Less I have, the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
And you will, yeah!

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah-yeah!

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, that's right!

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere

Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction, feel it burn

Still life incarnation
Still life infamy
Hallucination, heresy
Still you run
What's to come? What's to be?

'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down, all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace

Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down, all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out

(One, two)

Luck runs out

The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide, you hide, but will be found
Release your grip without a sound

Still life, immolation

Into your obsession
Never to return
This is your confession

Hunt you down without mercy

Hunt you down, all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out

Luck runs outEast of Omaha
You listen to the engines
Moanin' out its one song
You think about the woman
Or the girl you knew the night before

But your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're riding sixteen hours
And there's nothing much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was through

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing star again
There I go, turn the page

So you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explode

Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
Other times you can
Oh, the same old clichés
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Make your stand

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing star again
There I go, turn the page

Oh, out there in the spotlight
You're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy
You try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body
Like the music that you play, yeah

Later in the evening
As you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers
Ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Remembering what she said
What she said

Hey

Yeah, and here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on that stage
Here I go, playing star again
There I go, turn the page
There I go, turn that page

There I go, yeah, yeah
There I go, yeah, yeah, yeah
There I go, yeah
Here I go, yeah
There I go, oh
There I go
And I'm goneClose my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes, just to have them close again
Well on my way, but on my way to where I've been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world a nod

Open doors, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes, just to have them close once again
Don't want control as it takes me down and down and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?

The higher you are, the farther you fall
The longer the walk, the farther you crawl
My body, my temple, this temple it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built

The higher you are, the farther you fall
The longer the walk, the farther you crawl
My body, my temple, this temple it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built, yeah

Open doors, as I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take this in

Raised from my grave by the dead

Feel safe, in the danger
Feel good, in the bad

In love with my struggle
In love with my pain
Much needed to keep me down again
Don't allow myself to feel too good
Unworthy of me, couldn't if I could
Feel safe, in the danger
Feel good, in the bad

God! The burning,I've got the speed
Lose your turn, you crash and burn, you walk away

'Cause it ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out

And you crawl back in
Deep in your obsession
Since you've crashed and burned
This is your confession

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs outInsist on playing games
Some waste of time you are
And you're so popular

Well this is it, you bitch
I've got to make my switch
I'm just another john
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
No, too late, too late

I thought you was for real
But you're a rip-off deal
Don't give me all that crap
I just escaped your trap

I think you see the joke
But you're just chasin' smoke
You ain't another one
Know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Hello, too late, too late
Oh

Get on it

Misunderstanding me
The way you feel so free
I'm gonna jump the gun
Oh I'm gonna hit and run

Your credibility
Don't cut no ice with me
Another privilege gone
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh oh, too late, too late
Oh, too late, too lateConstant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tollsRight, right here, I stay...

Stand silent in flames...
Stand tall 'til it fades...

Shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
I said, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet 
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, shoot me again, shoot me
Shoot me again, shoot me again
Come on, shoot me again, shoot me again, shoot me
Shoot me again, shoot me again

Come on!
All the shots I take, I spit back at you
All the shit you fake comes back to haunt you
All the shots! All the shots!
All the shots I take...
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take, I spit back at you, oh-oh-ohh

I won't go away...
(With a bullet in my back!)
Right, right here, I stay...
(With a bullet in my back!)

Shoot me  {Take a shot}
Shoot me  {Take a shot}
Shoot me  {Take a shot}
Shoot me  {Take a shot}

I stand on my own...
(With a bullet in my back!)
I'm stranded and sold...
(With a bullet in my back!)

Shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Yeah, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
I said, shoot me again, shoot me again, come on
Shoot me again, shoot me again

All the shots I take, I spit back at you
All the shit you fake comes back to haunt you
All the shots!  All the shots!
All the shots I take...
Hey, what difference did I make?
All the shots I take, spit back at you, oh-oh-ohh

I bite my tongue, tryin' not to shoot back
No compromise, my heart won't pump the other way

Wake the sleeping giant, wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog, no, let him sleep 
Wake the sleeping giant, wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog, no, let him sleep

I bite my tongue, tryin' not to shoot back

All the shots I take, spit back at you, yea'eh'eh
All the shit you fake comes back to haunt you
All the shots!  All the shots!
All the shots I take...
Hey, what difference did I make?
Yeah, all the shots I take, spit back at you, oh-oh-ohhDrifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly loss, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel

Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try

Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
GoodbyeNo one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant till I fall

Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away

Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man

Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear, glory-seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see, the slaughter never ends

Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away

Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man

Why am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here

Why am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying

Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, moulded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend, alone I clench my gun

Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greetings Death, he's yours to take away

Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward, you servant, you blind man, back to the front

Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the frontUniverse much too big to see
Time and space, never ending
Disturbing thoughts, questions pending
Limitation of human understanding

Too quick to criticize
Obligation to survive
We hunger to be alive, yeah-h'eah!

(Twisting, turning, through the never)
All that is, ever... Ever was... Will be, ever,
Twisting, turning, through the never!

In the dark, see past our eyes
Pursuit of truth no matter where it lies
Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens
On a quest: Meaning... Reason...
Came to be... How it begun

All alone in the family of the sun
Curiosity teasing everyone
On our home, third stone from the sun, yeah-h'eah-h'eah!

(Twisting, turning, through the never)
All that is, ever... Ever was... Will be, ever,
Twisting, turning, through the never!

(On through the never)
We must go  (On through the never)
Out to the  (Edge of forever)
We must go  (On through the never)
The never comes!

(Twisting, turning, through the never)
All that is, ever... Ever was... Will be, ever,
Twisting, turning...
Who we are, ask forever
Twisting, turning, through the never!
Never!Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel

Not the word
Not the love
Not what you thought from above

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed!

Find your peace
Find your say
Find the smooth road on your way

Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

It feeds
It grows
It clouds all that you will know
Deceit
Deceive
Decide just what you believe

I see faith in your eyes
Never you hear the discouraging lies
I hear faith in your cries
Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed!

Broken is the promise, betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed!

Follow the god that failed!
Broken is the promise
Betrayal, betrayal, yeah!You don't actually care
You don't actually care
Love for you is no beginning
You're not really there
Hallucination

I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination

I understand you think you're above it
The adolescent sense of the sky
The feeling of billowing heartbeats
The fingertips run through your hair

They run through your hair
Hallucination
Hallucination

Oh, you think you're so special
That there's no law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are
We're mere mortals below
Fingertips run through your hair
We are mere mortals below

Are meant to be peons
Are meant to be servants
Are meant to be dismissible objects
One fucks with
One fucks with

Poor pitiful creature

The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every minuscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy

An idiot's idiocy
My, my caring for you
Caring for you
Do you think we're a book
Some kind of a table
You can rest your feet on when you're able
Red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
Poor pitiful creature

To notice the pining
The self deprivation
The self flagellation of you
Dear worshipers
We do like you regal
We do like you haughty
We do love to look upon your perfect body

The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
The taste of your vulva and everything on it
We all really love you
And you have no meaning
You don't even see us
You were never caring

You go do what you do
You do it for you
No one exists with you
You're way above caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Thinking of you
Is another way of dying
Is another way of dying

I'm clawing your chest
Till your collarbone bleeds
Piercing your nipples till I bite them off
I scratch your face and bite your shoulders
Way above caring
Way above caring
And your Kotex jukebox
Your Kotex jukebox

I'm doomed, I'm swearing
Waiting for you
In your high heels and nightie
Your leather dress squeaking
Latex now sweating, waiting for you
In your tincture
Your opium white bathrobe
Your white tiles run red now
Are we both dead now?

The liquid exchange of our heart
The liquid exchange of our heart
Are we both dead now?

You're way above caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring
My caring for you
My caring for you
You're way beyond caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy

My caring for you
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Because thinking of you
Is another way of dying

You're way above caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
You poor pitiful creature
The mistake of feeling
The one who rejects you is the winner
It's true

The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every minuscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
Your heart on your fuckin' sleeve
My caring for you
We were meant to be peons
We're meant to be peons
Mere mortals below
Meant to be servants

Meant to be dismissible objects one fucks with
Oh oh oh, you're so special
No law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are

The fingertips run through your hair
A billowing heart beats
Feeling
Feeling
What a glorious feeling
To be so rejected
So rejected

An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
You think I'm a book or a table
You can rest your fuckin' feet on
When you're able

The taste of your vulva, everything on it
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
We do love you, to look upon your perfect body
We love you regal
We love you haughty
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Caring

Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oblivious to caring

Are we really dead now?
Are we both dead now?The words are cutting deep inside my brain
Thunder burning, quickly burning
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane yeah

Raven black is on my track
He shows me how to neutralize the knife
Show to me in surgery
The art of fighting words to conquer life, conquer life, yeah

Now the wicked lance of fear
Is driving from my heady mountain brain
Crash course in brain surgery
Has stopped the bloody knife of words again, yeah yeah yeahWoah oh

Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for
Love me till the end of time, yeah yeah
She make me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mine

I am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime

I've lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child that never was conceived

You gotta believe me
Hey, I'm talking to you

Well, I know, it's hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
More when it's time to die

Don't believe the life you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on, ha ha

Whoa, feel so happy since I met that girl

Oh ooh, she makes me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mine
She's all mine, yeah
Yo, yeahNo one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred

Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "Rage"

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?

No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone

Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out againSaid, don't tread on me!

"Liberty or death!",
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke Her:
Rattling of Her tail

Never begins it
Never, but once engaged:
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage!
Said, don't tread on me!

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it!  Settle the score!
Touch me again, for the words that- 
-you will hear ever more:  "Don't tread on me!"

Love it or leave it!
She, with the deadly bite
Quick as the blue tongue,
Forked as a lighting strike

Shining with brightness
Always on surveillance
(Eyes that never close)  Emblem of vigilance!
H'ooh, no-no-no'oh... So don't tread on me!

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it!  Settle the score!
Touch me again, for the words that- 
-you will hear ever more:  "Don't tread on me!"

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war...
"Liberty or death!",
What we so proudly hail
Once you provoke Her:
Rattling of Her tail

So be it!  Threaten no more!
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it!  Settle the score!
Touch me again, for the words that- 
-you will hear ever more:  "Don't tread on me!"

*(Yes, "Her" is supposed to be capitalized. Do not change.)One crown born to lose
One man does not give a damn
One man, no excuse

Aces wild
Aces high
All the aces
Aces till you die

White lines fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to win

One fist hammers through the mist
One fist, steady on
One heart, die hard from the start
One heart beats its song

Murder all
Murder one
Gimme murder
Second class to none

Headlights fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to win

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
No excuse

Till the end
Been living to win
Been living to winPut dignity to shame, dishonor
Witch hunt, modern day, determining decay
The blatant disarray, disfigure
The public eyes' disgrace, defying common place
Unending paper chase, unending
Deafening, painstaking
Reckoning, this vertigo it doth bring

Shortest straw, challenge liberty
Downed by law, live in infamy
Rub you raw, witch hunt riding through
Shortest straw, this shortest straw has been pulled for you

Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

The accusations fly, discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die, intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you, its teeth and talons through
You're living catch-22, deluding
A mass hysteria, a megalomania
Reveal dementia, reveal
Secretly, silently
Certainly in vertigo you will be

Shortest straw, challenge liberty
Downed by law, live in infamy
Rub you raw, witch hunt riding through
Shortest straw, this shortest straw has been pulled for you

Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

Shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Pulled for you, shortest straw
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

Behind you, hands are tied, your being, ostracized
Your Hell is multiplied, upending
The fallout has begun, oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none to nothing
You're reaching your nadir, your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear, defending
Channels red, one word said
Blacklisted with vertigo make you dead

Shortest straw, challenge liberty
Downed by law, live in infamy
Rub you raw, witch hunt riding through
Shortest straw, this shortest straw has been pulled for you
Pulled for youI'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"

Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"

Master, master
Master, master

Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
Promised only lies
Laughter, laughter
All I hear and see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me

Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Neverending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your master
Master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind, smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
"Master, master"Oh poor twisted me
I feast on sympathy
I chew on suffer
I chew on agony

And swallow whole the pain
Oh it's too good to be
All this misery
Is just for oh poor twisted me
Poor twisted me

Ooh yeah
Poor twisted me

Poor mistreated me
Poor mistreated me
I drown without a sea
I'm filled with sorrow
Once filled with misery

And hated the deep dark blue
Oh woe is me
Such a burden to bear
Poor mistreated me, yeah

Finally reached the shore
I survived the storm
Now you're feeling cold ever since he was born
Your pain is so over you

Finally reached the shore

Now you're feeling cold ever since he was born
No more

Your pain is so over you
Could ya be my friend?
Such a burden to see
Oh poor twisted me

Save ourselves before the earth bleeds

He takes in his medicine

Believer, deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life

Dear mother, dear father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator, dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

Dear mother, dear father
Time has frozen still, what's left to be
Hear nothing, say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Dear mother, dear father
You clipped my wings before I learnt to fly
Unspoiled, unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do

Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

I'm in Hell without you
Cannot cope without you too
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim, please rescue me

Dear mother, dear father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething, I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite, I feel for you
Living out this Hell you always knew

YouPop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed in the silence

Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless

Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral

Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
A delusion absolution

Perjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Oh, tell the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Burn

Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won't do, that fistful will

Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction

Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction

So light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Oh, no excuse
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Addicted to the
FameCome, won't you stay
Sincere, sincere
All ends in tears

Endure, endure
Thoughts most impure
Concede, concede
But both shall we bleed

Oh, halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell

I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire

Allure, allure
Sweetness obscure
Abide, abide
Secrets inside

Deprive, deprive
To feel so alive
Obey, obey
Just don't turn away

Oh, halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell

I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire

Prayers cannot get through
Return to sender
Unto which of you
Shall I surrender?

Twisting in disguise
Dark resurrection
Lighting up the skies
Wicked perfection

Too dark to sleep, can't slip away
Open or close, my eyes betray
Beyond the black, come, won't you stay?

Hello darkness, say goodbye
Hello darkness, say goodbye
Hello darkness, say goodbyeGrab this life and walk away
War is never done
Rub the patch and battle on
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life
The war that never ends

Leave the battlefield
Yet its horrors never heal
Coming home from war
Pieces don't fit anymore
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My life
The war that never ends

Father, please come home
Shell shocked all I've known
Father, please come home

Label him a deadwood soldier now
Cast away and left to roam
Rapid is the road to sacrifice
Just takes longer to come home, come home

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
Crossfire ricochets inside me
Trapped in a memory forever
My life
The war that never endsI know I'm my best friend
No one cares, but I'm so much stronger
I'll fight until the end

To escape from the true false world
Undamaged destiny
Can't get caught in the endless circle
Ring of stupidity

Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way

Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
Don't tell me what to do
I don't care now 'cause I'm on my side
And I can see through you

Feed my brain with your so called standards
Who says that I ain't right
Break away from your common fashion
See through your blurry sight

Out for my own, out to be free
One with my mind, they just can't see
No need to hear things that they say
Life is for my own to live my own way

See them try to bring the hammer down
No damn chains can hold me to the ground

Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way

Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own way
Life is for my own to live my own waySenseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia

Chained and shadowed to be left behind
Nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
Iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metalization of your inner soul
Twisting and turning

Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Metal militia
Metal militia
Metal militia

We are as one as we all are the same
Fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
Protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world

Eyes tell of morbid tales of his black heart
His deeds through ages past tell of his part

See his face
See his smile
Time to die
Oh, whoa, no

Angel from below, change my dreams
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns

See his face
See his smile
Time to die
Whoa, no, no

I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die

See his face, see his smile
Time to dieCurses rest on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All eternity

Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Hold the pose, feign perception
Grudges break your back

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardized in ruin
What have you become?

Blame the world and blame your maker
Wish 'em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!

Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down

Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles
All alone, the fear shall humble
Swallow all your pride

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on
Right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, rise!Haven't changed, your brain is still gelatine
Little whispers circle around your head
Why don't you worry about yourself instead

Who are you? Where ya been? Where ya from?
Gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue
You lie so much you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not

Before you judge me take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand

It's not who you are, it's who you know
Others lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and built them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are
You know not

(yeah! who the hell are you?)

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou

It's my world now, it's my world now
It's my world, it's my world

Mama, why's it raining in my room?
Cheer up boy, clouds will move on soon
Heavy fog got me lost inside
I'm gonna sit right back and enjoy this ride

It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world

I'm out my head, out of my head
Get 'em out my head, out of my head
Get 'em out

Who's in charge of my head today?
Dancin' devil's in angel's way

It's my time now, it's my time now
It's my time, yeah it's my time

Look out motherfuckers, here I come
I'm gonna make my head my home
The sons of bitches tried to take my head
Tried to make me someone else instead

It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world
It's my world, you can't have it
It's my world, it's my world

I don't even know what the question is
Not only do I not know the answer
I don't even know what the question is

God it feels like it only rains on me

Enough's enoughMoaning at the bed side
Moaning from each limb

Little dog who can't get in
Can only cry but
Can not swim

Pony legs, little trot
Little dog has to wait a lot

The bigger dog has got his spot
And elbowed him away

Listen to him barking
Listen to him call
Little dog don't have much at all

A puny body and a tiny dick
A little dog can make you sick

If you got the money you can go to the top
The female dog don't care what you got
As long as you can raise that
Little dogie face to a cold-hearted pussy
You could have a taste

A taste of what the big dog got
A taste of what the big dog got
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot
Can run his tongue over the hot in trot
Hot in trot
Run his tongue over the hot in trot

Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Tell me what you want

My small dog, he want what I got

Wants to run his tongue over my hot spot

Pathetic little dogDark deception kills the light

Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for father, roaming free

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great old one, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness you dwell

Crawling chaos underground
Cult has summoned twisted sound

Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep has been upset
He awakens, hunter of the shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness you dwell

In madness you dwell

Not dead which eternal lie
Stranger eons, death may die

Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great old one, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising

Immortal
In madness you dwellWhen I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski
In the dark of the moon

It made me dream of Nosferatu
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau
Oh, wouldn't it be lovely



I was thinking Peter Lorre when things got pretty gory
As I crossed to the Brandenburg Gate

I was feeling snappy, perhaps I'd been napping
And I'd just ate


A following heart can tear you apart
On a midnight to eight shift

A graveyard romance can only give one chance
As the tombstones weave and breathe


Feeling happy when my heart got beating
On a Sunday afternoon

I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses
And stars were still illumined


I have three hearts that I keep apart
Trying to relate
To normal feelings and the nighttime reelings
And some absinthe drunk so late

My small town girl
I'm just a small town girl


The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk
Onto the size of dessert plates

But me I'm happy 'cause I got my little nappy
And some opium to set me straight


I'm just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl
While my looks still hold me straight

Straight up to illusion and fantasy's fusion
Of reality mixed with drink


I'm just a small town girl who's gonna give life a whirl
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate
I'm just a 
Small town girl, she was like a whirl


The Brandenburg Gate
I'm just a small town girl
Small town girl


I'm just a small town girlWeak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery

Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery
Battery

Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery

Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery

Battery
Battery
BatteryBetter just stay down
You pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the ground
Mouths so full of lies
Tend to block your eyes
Just keep them closed, keep prayin', just keep waitin'

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comes

Push you 'cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself, crawl in yourself, you'll have your time
God, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day, I'll splatter color on this gray

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison

I suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear: The sun will shine
This I swear
This I swear
This I swearTainted misery
Bleed, battle scars
Chemical affinity

Reign, legacy
Innocence corrode
Stain, rot away
Catatonic overload

Choke, asphyxia
Snuff reality
Scorch, kill the light
Incinerate celebrity

Reaper, butchery
Karma amputee
Bloodline redefined
Death contagious deity

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
You burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind
You've reached the end of the line

Time, choke the clock
Steal another day
Die faithfully
Narcissistic fade away

Twisted, jump the rail
Shatter the crowd below
Breaker, chase the ghost
From latest high to all-time low

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
You burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind
You've reached the end of the line

Drop the hourglass of time
Spilling sand we will not find
As we gather here today
We bid farewell
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
Yeah

The slave becomes the master
Need more and more
Right now and ever after
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burned through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime
Never mind

Dead hourglass of time
Sand we will not ever find
We gather here today
Say goodbye
'Cause you've reached the end of the line

The end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line

You've reached the end of the lineIt looks different, so different than what you see
Projecting judgment on the world
This house is clean baby
This house is clean

Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Look out my window and see it's gone wrong
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector, projector
Rejector, infector, injector, defector, rejector 

I see my reflection in the window
This window clean inside, dirty on the out
I'm looking different than me
This house is clean baby
This house is clean

Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
I look out my window and see it's gone wrong
The court is in session and I slam my gavel down

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector, projector
Rejector, infector, injector, defector, rejector, detector

I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too

Projector, protector, rejector, infector, projector
Rejector, infector, injector, defector, rejector

I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throne
I drink from the cup of denial
I'm judging the world from my throneOil on the wheel
That is blasted and busted away

A nail or a little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
Swarming like bees over the air
Off the pump off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away

Like bees over the air
Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away

Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away

If I pump blood in the sunshine
And you wear a leather box with azaleas
And I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart

As I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin

Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart

If I'm pumping blood
Like a common state worker
If I waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Would you think less of me

And my coagulating heart

Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Coagulating heart
Pumping blood

Would you top me off
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy
While you yell out, "mercy"
We grow apart
Would you rip and cut me

Use a knife on me

Be shocked at the boldness
The coldness of this little heart
Tied up in leather
Would you take the measure
Of the blood that I pump
In the manic confusion of love

Supreme violation
Supreme violation
"Oh, ah, ah, ah Jack I beseech you"

"Oh Jack I beseech you"
Supreme violation

Blood in the foyer
The bathroom
The tea room
The kitchen, with her knives splayed

I will swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick

Blood spurting from me
"Oh Jack, Jack I beseech:"
"Jack, I beseech you, I beseech:"
In the end it was an ordinary heart

"Oh Jack I beseech you"
As I scream out my pain
In the end it was an ordinary heart

In the end, in the end, in the end
It was an ordinary heart

"Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"
Supreme violation . . . Oh

"Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"
I call out your name

Blood in the foyer, the bathroom,
The tea room, the kitchen
And knives splayed
I swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick
Blood spurting from me
Blood spurting from me

"Oh Jack"

"Oh Jack, I beseech ya"
In the end it was an ordinary heart

In the end it was an ordinary heart
Pumping blood.Blacks the light
Blacks the sound
Fear the thought of it never ever coming back
Leave the shift to the round


Open up your gate
Spirits I elate
Watch the falling sand
Shifting through his hand
Open Up Your Gate
Spirits I elate
Whisper To Your Friends
Death Is Not The End!

Not the End
Not the End
It's the beginning
It's a…

Paid my dues in the cell
Be the toll of the bell

Spirits I elate
Watch the falling sand
Slipping through his hand
Open Up Your Gate
Spirits I elate
Whisper To Your Friends
Death Is Not The End!

Not the End
Not the End
It's the begining

Death is not the end!Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face that learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite

Like a misery that keeps me focused though I've gone astray
Like an endless nightmare that I must awaken from each day
Like conviction, a premonition
Not worthy of, so I deny, I deny

I blind my eyes and try and force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went, almost like your life

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a raging river, drowning, when I only need a drink
Like a poison that I swallow
But I want the world to die

Like a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in
Like a fight to live the past, I prayed to leave, from way back then
Like a general without a mission
Until the war will start again, start again

I blind my eyes and try and force it all into place
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace
I blind my eyes, I hide and feel it passing me by
I open just in time to say goodbye

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went, almost like your life

Like a touch from Hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a strike from Heaven, turns that key
And brings you straight down to your knees

Like a touch from Hell to feel how hot
That it can get if I get caught
Like a strike from Heaven, to reprieve
That brings you straight down to your knees

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Curse the day is long
Realize you don't belong

Disconnect somehow
Never stop the bleeding now
Almost like your fight
And there it went, almost like your life

That was just your lifeCrawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Fear thy name: Extermination
Desecrate, inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Deadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still

Fear thy name: Annihilation
Desolate, inhale the fire

So we cross that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
My apocalypse
Go

Crushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body, mannequin
Spilling blood, bleeding gas

Mangle flesh, snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass

Split apart
Split apart
Split apart
Spit
Spit it out

What makes me drift a little bit closer?
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over?
Born to repeat until I feel

See through the skin, the bones they all rattle
Future and past, they disagree
Flesh falls away, the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me
See the end in me

Claustrophobic
Climb out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Violate, annihilate
All wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate, exterminate
As life itself denied

Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny inhale the fire

But we've crossed that line
Into the grips
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse

Tyrant awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypseMirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd cry the nowhere tears of honor
Like twisted vines that grow
Hide and swallow mansions whole
Dim the light of an already faded primadonna

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
But the memory remains

Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgets
While the Hollywood sun sets behind your back
And can't the band play on?
Just listen, they play my song
Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fade to black

Fortune, fame
Mirror vain
Gone insane
Fortune, fame

Faith of the unknown one, the deliverer
Wait, something must be done for hundred years

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Now, let my people go, land of Goshen
Go, I will be with thee, bush of fire
Blood, running red and strong, down the Nile
Plague, darkness three days long, hail to fire

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping death

Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first-born man
Die by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first-born man

I rule the midnight air, the destroyer
Born, I shall soon be there, deadly mass
I creep the steps and floor, final darkness
Blood, lambs blood painted door, I shall pass

So let it be written
So let it be done
I'm sent here by the chosen one
So let it be written
So let it be done
To kill the first born Pharaoh son
I'm creeping deathSaint Anger 'round my neck

Fuck it all, and no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
I need a voice to let myself, to let myself go free
Fuck it all, and fucking no regrets
I hit the lights on these dark sets
Put down the noose, I'll hang myself
Saint Anger 'round my neck

I feel my world shake like an earthquake
It's hard to see clear: Is it me? Is it fear?

I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you
I'm madly in anger with you

That we should see the light

When reaper calls
May it be
That we walk straight and right

When doubt returns
May it be
That faith shall permeate our scars

When we're seduced
Then may it be
That we not deviate our cause

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

When all is pain
May it be
It's all we've ever known

When flame consumes
May it be
It warms our dying bones

When loss has won
May it be
It's you I'm madly fighting for

When Kingdom comes
May it be
We walk right through that open door

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live, we can live forever

Return to ashes, shed this skin
Beyond the black, we rise again
We shall live foreverYesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the fire

Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, not this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the sky

Unchain the colours before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return from out of the fire

Fire
Fire
Fire
FIRE!!Once you have seen it, you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it is heavy and dirty and mean

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know, whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once, so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others, the same song and dance

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath awayTake me with you
Tell me, does your sun still shine?
Come squeeze the world 
Then drip it down my throat again
Down my throat again, oh-whoa

You got to breathe, man, breathe
Coming up for...
Breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for...
Air

Touch me so I think I'm here
Skin my senses
Barely breathing, minus human
Please squeeze the world 
And drip it down my throat again
Ooh, down my throat again

Whoa, oh...
You've got to breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for air
Breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for...
Air

You've got to breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up for air
Breathe, man, breathe
Comin' up forAll I want is some special care
On the run from some institution
All I want is some constellation

And I can tell by your face
I'm a total disgrace
Put me inside this place
Move over for a damage case

Hey baby, wait a minute, stop
Don't run away, don't call a cop
I ain't lookin' to victimize you
All I want to do is tantalize you

I can tell by your face
I'm all over the place
I can tell by your face
Got no time for a damage case

No time, baby

Hey babe,don't turn away
I'm here tomorrow, gone today
I don't know what you think your game is
I don't care if even what your name is

And I can tell by this face
You're all over the place
I can tell by your face
Move over for a damage case

Get the fuck over, manHere I go now
Here I go into new days
Hey, hey, hey
Here I go now
Here I go into new days

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah hey hey hey hey hey
Here I go into new days

Hey, hey, hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me
Hey, hey, hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Yeah, hey, hey
Ain't no mercy
Ain't no mercy there for me

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Hey, hey, hey
And I went
And I went on down that road
Hey, hey, hey
And I went on
And I went on down that road

I'm pain, I'm hope, I'm suffer
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappear

Do you bury me when I'm gone?
Do you teach me while I'm here?
Just as soon as I belong
Then it's time I disappearConstant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tollsThe window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms, no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
Someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Can't you hear your babies crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still, they try and break me

Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now deservingly this easy chair
But the rocking's stopped by wheels of despair

Don't want your hate
But the fist I've made
For years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me
While I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Can't you hear your names?
Can't you hear your babies crying?

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try
Mama, they try

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try
Mama, they tryOoh yeah, baby, h'oh-h'oh...
Oh, what was these words right here...
When I get you in my guts...
It makes me play, way too fuckin' good, yeah...

[Battery:]

Lashing out the action - Returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me - Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression - Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery - Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me... Battery... Battery

Crushing all deceivers - Mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me - Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression - Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery - Cannot kill the family
Battery is found in me... Battery... Battery

Circle of Destruction - Hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the Battery

Smashing through the boundaries

Holding the lion's share, holding the key
Holding me back 'cause I'm striving to be

Better than youIf the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honey

Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey

If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honey

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb

If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long

If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heart breaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start

And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy

If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like hell, the River Styx
Your affection never sticks

No matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honey.If I was half drowning
An arm above the last wave

Would you come to me
Would you pull me up
Would the effort really hurt you
Is it unfair to ask you
To help pull me up

The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating

Pull me up
Would you be my lord and savior
Pull me up by my hair
Now would you kiss me, on my lips

Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening now
Shoots out its tiresome message

Won't you pull me up
Scalding, my dead father
Has the motor and he's driving towards
An island of lost souls

Sunny, a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness
No social redeeming kindness
Or - oh, state of grace

Would you pull me up
Would you drop the mental bullet
Would you pull me by the arm up
Would you still kiss my lips
Hiccup, the dream is over
Get the coffee, turn the lights on
Say hello to junior dad
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
Psychic savagery

The greatest disappointment
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad.Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must soothe you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heard
You...you're smothered in tragedy
And you're out to save the world

Misery!
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery!
There's much more to life than what you see
My Friend Of Misery!

You still stood there screaming!
No-one caring about these words you tell
My friend before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You... you'll take it on all yourself
(Remember), Misery loves company

Misery!
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My Friend Of Misery!

Misery!
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My Friend Of Misery
My Friend Of Misery!

You just stood there screaming, oh
My Friend Of Misery!Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before
Been here before

Been here before, couldn't say I liked it
Do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be uncrazy?

Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could, I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'

It comes alive
It comes alive
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive	
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Been here before
Been here before

I'm frantic in your soothing arms 
I cannot sleep in this down-filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I can not stand it anymore

Cross my heart hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon

It comes alive
It comes alive
It comes alive
And I die a little more
It comes alive
Each moment here I die a little more

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive	
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive	
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away

Get the fuck out of here
I just wanna get the fuck away from me
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I hate it all, why? Why? Why me?

I cannot sleep with a head like this
I wanna cry, I wanna scream
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I wanna hate it all away

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive	
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way
And I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
Takes me away
Yeah, takes me away

Then the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me awayOoh, no matter where you dwell
You,here again, a captive of the howl
You, welcome back to hell

Faithful as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks angers reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore

Ooh, tooth is fang, twisting under skin
Ooh, foul tongue, black breath
Change, snap inside, the beast about complete
Change, soon infects the rest

Faithful as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks angers reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Howling at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore
Anymore

Ooh,inheritance, the past has bit again
Ooh, the next heir of anarchy
Feel stretching skin so far beyond belief
I feel the ever changing, you, in me

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
Howling evermore
Am I savage?
I don’t recognize me anymore
Anymore

Anymore, ha ha ha
Am I savage?Speak the words I wanna hear to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me, then I can understand the you

Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining...

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn to stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

Come lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it

What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits
The one who waits for you

Oh, what I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you
(So I dub thee unforgiven....)

Oh, what I've felt...
Oh, what I've known...
I take this key (never free...)
And I bury it (never me...) in you
Because you're unforgiven too

Never free
Never me
'Cause you're unforgiven too
OhThe Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell
And his money he was countin'

I first produced my pistol
And then produced my rapier
I said, "Stand and deliver."
Oh, "Or the Devil, he may take ya."

Yeah

I took all of his money
And it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money

Yeah-ehCharging hard and no one's going to give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty

Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct, not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated

Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we're the cure

Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, Incorporated

We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
Damage, Incorporated
Go

Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt

Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy endings on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage, Inc. you see
Step a little closer, if you please

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
Damage, IncorporatedNo thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need the feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding
All hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts a-flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorse"Suppose," I say...
"You cut some root to make the tree survive."

Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once
I'm, oh, so bored to death!

Ooh, I hunger... I hunger... I eat!

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire,
And run like hell

Why cure the fever?
What ever happened to sweat?

"Suppose," I say... "The vultures smile at me."
"Suppose," I say...
"I sent them down and they plan to pick you clean."

And satisfaction, this way, comes
And satisfaction, this way, comes
And satisfaction's here and gone,
Gone, yeah, gone again!

Oh, I hunger... Ooh, I hunger... I eat!

Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel

The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children, now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you've got some company

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds, they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen, ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeah

You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it's all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once, a sinner twice
No need for confessions now
'Cause now you've got the fight of your life

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds, they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen, ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeah

Time has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine, your body, it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence, for what you had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death, deliverance, for you, for sure
Now there's nothing you can do

So, gather 'round, young warriors, now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor, blood, guts, and sweat

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die

Sleepless, cloaked in despair
I'm behind you

Blurring lines of right and wrong
Far too late for frail amends

Desperate hands that lose control
Have no mercy on your soul
On your soul

"Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore its done
The brightest flame burns quickest."
That's what I heard her say
A son's heart's sewed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Yeah, still

Rebel, my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what I said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave

So let this heart be still

Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
But a mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
Yeah, I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me, yeah, yeah
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Oh-whoa

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
That I'll take to my grave

So let this heart be stillThese are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the Kingdom of Salvation take me home?And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you

Ain't gonna waste my hate
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myself

Ain't gonna give no more

I think it's time you pleased yourself
Yourself

And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Hate

You think you're worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?

I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hell's my mind going now?
Dead gone now

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
There's a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain
I fall 'cause I let go
The net below has rot away
So my eyes seek reality
And my fingers seek my veins

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see 
What I've let me be 
So wicked and worn
So as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause Low Man is due

Please forgive me

My eyes seek reality
My fingers feel for faith
Touched clean with a dirty hand
I touch the clean to the waste

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm, yeah
And I can't bear to see 
What I've let me be 
So wicked and worn
So as I write to you, yeah
Of what is done and to do, yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause Low Man is due

Please forgive me
Please forgive me
Please forgive me

So low, the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again
I cry to the alleyway
Confess all to the rain
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror
The one I've broken to match my face

The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
Why I've let me be so wicked and wild
So as I write to you, yeah
Of what is done and to do, yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause Low Man is due

Please forgive me
Please forgive me

So low, the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again

My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins

(humming)And you will see
Just call my name and I'll be there

You cannot touch me
You would not dare
I am the chill that's in the air

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the day

Dark rivers are flowing
Back into the past
You are the fish for which I cast

And what of the future?
What is to be?
As the rivers flow into the sea

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the day

Do not take for granted
Powers out there
Don't step into the demon's lair

Time is an illusion
Rising from time
Steep is the mountain which we climb

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the dayHave this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

And it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

Hard and cold, bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Yeah, are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Yaw, nothing
Oh where's your crown?

Huh!

Wish I may
Wish I might
Have this wish, I wish tonight
I want that star
I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how

Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish you may regret it
Careful what you wish you just might get it

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the King
But the castle's crumbled and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Nothing

No, you're just nothing
Where's your crown King Nothing?
No, you're just nothing
Absolutely nothing
Off to Never-NeverlandOne, two, three, four, five

Spineless from the start
Sucked into the part
Circus comes to town
You play the lead clown

Please, please
Spreading his disease, living by his story
Knees, knees
Falling to your knees, suffer for his glory
You will

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Marvel at his tricks
Need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came
Rotting your brain

Chain, chain
Join the endless chain, taken by his glamour
Fame, fame
Infection is the game, stinking drunk with power
We see

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to Leper Messiah

Witchery, weakening
See the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow

Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, Heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat

Lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lieCrawl out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Ain't no one gonna watch the road
Intention reckless
Ain't no one gonna slow the row
Invention reckless

So I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane

Deadly pulse
Pawing at the wheel
Death Magnetic
Pulling closer still

Ain't no one gonna hold the border
Insanely reckless
Ain't no one gonna give the order
Inanely reckless

So I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane

I scare myself

Crushing metal, Ripping Skin
Tossing body mannequin
Splatter Blood, Bleeding Gas

Mangle flesh, Snapping spine
Dripping bloody valentine
Shatter face, spitting glass

What makes me drift a litter bit closer
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over
Dead man takes the steering wheel

See through the skin the bones they all rattle
I start to see the end in me
Flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me

Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Hard explosive
Reach in, pull that pin

Every moment, flashed before my eyes
I wake up SCREAMING
Life is undenied

Ain't no one gonna search the wreckage
Intensely reckless
Ain't no one gonna get the message
Inherently reckless

I cross that line
Pushing myself, daring myself
Scaring myself in the suicide lane

Pushing myself in the suicide lane
Daring myself in the suicide lane
Pushing myself in the suicide lane
Daring myself in the suicide laneMotives changing
Day to day
The fire increases
Masks decay

I look at the river
White foam floats down
The body's poisoned
Got to sit tight

The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait

After awakening
The silence grows
The screams subside
Distortion shows

Mutant thoughts
Of bad mouthed news
It's just another birth
Of distorted views

The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait

The wait
The wait
The wait
The waitNo emergency
Like a blind man that is strapped into the speeding driver's seat
Like a face
That learns to speak
When all it knew was how to bite

Like a hurt that keeps me focused
Though I think I've gone astray
Like a low grade nightmare that
I must awaken from each day
Like a dream
A beautiful dream
Not worthy of, so I deny...... Yeah

You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
You never open them, so it passed you by
You close your eyes, so you may never fall from grace
You open just in time to say goodbye, oh

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Like a wound that keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think
Like a spring that cannot be in current till
It's time to drink
Like a puzzle
With missing pieces
And the box is thrown away

Like a release from a prison
That you didn't know you're in
Like a fight to live the past I prayed
To leave
From way back then
Like a general
Without a mission
Until the war will start again......

You close your eyes and try to wish it all into place
You never open them, so it passed you by
You close your eyes, so you may never fall from grace
You open just in time to say goodbye, oh

Almost like your life
Almost like your endless fight
Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight
And there it went
Almost like your life

Yeah
Oh, yeah

Oh, yeah

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught
Like a touch from heaven on this breeze
That brings you straight down to your knees

Like a touch from hell to feel how hot
That it can get if you get caught

Struggling along
Balancing in right and wrong
Why is this so hard?
Always pull the joker card
Almost like your fight

Almost like your life
That was just your lifeThe deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying death pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

The leather armies have prevailed
The phantom lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

Fall to your knees and bow to the phantom lordAll within my hands

Kill, kill, kill, kill, killI've gotta bad reputation
I don't care, I get my share
Don't feel no deprivation

The more I get the better it is
I like it fine, like a little whiz
Treat 'em like ladies, that's a fact
You know the chase is better than the catch

Silver tongued devil, demon leach
You know just what I'm doing
I like a little innocent bitch
You know I ain't just screwing

I love you baby, love you too much
I like you fine I feel your touch
But your appearance don't hold no class
You know the chase is better than the catch

A little beauty I love you madly
Come on home with me
I know you're hot, I know what you've got
You know I want to shake your tree

Come on honey touch me right there
Come on honey don't you get scared
Come on honey let me get you in the sack
You know the chase is better than the catchPlanting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth

Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back what used to be
Drink up, shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain

Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto me

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow

All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies
Infanticide

Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad

Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never Land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never Land
Yeah-heah!

Now I lay me down to sleep

Pray the Lord my soul to keep

If I die before I wake

Pray the Lord my soul to take

And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night

He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath

He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving earth its bleeding
Pure madness alive

And he haunts you
And he binds your soul
And he loathes you
And reclaims it all

You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say

Cthulhu, awaken

He sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyes

Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

Fully loaded Tommy gun

They're gonna put me in a cell
If I can't go to Heaven, let me go to Hell

YeahWhile clutching to what you had thought was real

Kicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showin' your gratitude
S's'so many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to lose?

(What the Hell?)  What the Hell?
What is it you think you're gonna' find?

(Struggle within!)  It suits you fine!
(Struggle within!)  Your ruin!
(Struggle within!)  You seal your own coffin!
(Struggle within!)  The struggling within!

Home is not a home, it becomes a Hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your Hell

Grabbing for something you've got to feel
(Closing in)  Closing in!
Pressure upon you is so unreal!

I have stripped of all but pride
So in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied
Gives me all I need

And with dust in throat I crave
Only knowledge will I save
To the game you stay as slave

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will, yeah!

Oh, but I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah!

(And the Earth becomes my throne)
And the Earth becomes my throne
I adapt to the unknown
Under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone
I ask no one

And my ties are severed clean
Less I have, the more I gain
Off the beaten path I reign

Rover, wanderer
Nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will
And you will, yeah!

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, yeah-yeah!

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my find anywhere
Anywhere I roam
Where I lay my head is home, that's right!

But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhere

You listen to the engines
Moanin' out its one song
You think about the woman
Or the girl you knew the night before

But your thoughts will soon be wandering
The way they always do
When you're riding sixteen hours
And there's nothing much to do
And you don't feel much like riding
You just wish the trip was through

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing star again
There I go, turn the page

So you walk into this restaurant
Strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you
As you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you
But you just want to explode

Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk
Other times you can
Oh, the same old clichés
"Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered
You don't dare make a stand
Make your stand

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing star again
There I go, turn the page

Oh, out there in the spotlight
You're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy
You try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body
Like the music that you play, yeah

Later in the evening
As you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers
Ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette
Remembering what she said
What she said

Hey

Yeah, and here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on that stage
Here I go, playing star again
There I go, turn the page
There I go, turn that page

And I'm goneClose my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes, just to have them close again
Well on my way, but on my way to where I've been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world a nod

Open doors, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes, just to have them close once again
Don't want control as it takes me down and down and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?

The higher you are, the farther you fall
The longer the walk, the farther you crawl

And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral

YeahCrawling from the wreckage one more time
This map is tattered, can't read the signs
Though the body's rusted
Isn't hard to turn
On the path of destruction, feel it burn
Feel safe, in the danger
Feel good, in the bad

God! The burning,I've got the speed
Lose your turn, you crash and burn, you walk away

'Cause it ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out

Luck (luck,luck), Runs (runs,runs), Out (out,out)
In love with my struggle
In love with my pain
Much needed to keep me down again
Don't allow myself to feel too good
Unworthy of me, couldn't if I could
Feel safe, in the danger
Feel good, in the bad

God! The burning,I've got the speed
Lose your turn, you crash and burn, you walk away

'Cause it ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out

And you crawl back in
Deep in your obsession
Since you've crashed and burned
This is your confession

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong
Crash and burn then you walk away
How many times can I hear you say

Ain't no good when there's nothing
Ain't no good when you can't go wrong, yeah
Luck, runs, out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs outInsist on playing games
Some waste of time you are
And you're so popular

Well this is it, you bitch
I've got to make my switch
I'm just another john
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
No, too late, too late

I thought you was for real
But you're a rip-off deal
Don't give me all that crap
I just escaped your trap

I think you see the joke
But you're just chasin' smoke
You ain't another one
Know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Hello, too late, too late
Oh

Get on it

Misunderstanding me
The way you feel so free
I'm gonna jump the gun
Oh I'm gonna hit and run

Your credibility
Don't cut no ice with me
Another privilege gone
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh oh, too late, too late
Oh, too late, too lateConstant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see, what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tollsCan't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops with me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Now the world is gone I'm just one
Oh God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me

Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hellWe do our best, you're the rest, you make it real, you know
There's a feeling deep inside that drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead, you need it oh so bad

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!

Bang your head against the stage like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore
In a frenzied madness with your leather and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around, it's hot as hell tonight

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!

Here on the stage the Marshalls' noise is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kick your face, exploding feeling nears
Now's the time to let it rip, to let it fuckin' loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill, 'cause this is what we choose

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

Here we go!

Whiplash!

The show is through, the metal's gone, it's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig, again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways, life out here is raw
But we'll never stop, we'll never quit, 'cause we're Metallica

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniacAnd quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules

With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

You labeled me
I'll label you
So I dub thee unforgiven

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

You labeled me
I'll label you
So I dub thee unforgiven

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgivenDolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sin

So you lay us in a line
Push your pins, they make us humble
Only you can tell, in time,
If we fall or merely stumble

But tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away, so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free,
You jab another pin, jab another pin in me

Yeah...
Mirror, mirror upon thy wall
Break this spell or become the doll

See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us,
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time the needles turn from shine to rust

But tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away, so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free,
Jab another pin, jab another pin in me...
Jab it... ("Here come the pins")

Blood for face, sweat for dirt
Three X's for the stone
To break this curse, a ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone

Shell of shotgun, pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith which way we can
To fall in love with life again

To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love, to fall in love
To fall in love with life again

So tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away, so we may start again?

Yeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free,
Jab another pin, jab another pin in me
Yeah-eh-eh-h'eah

No more pins in me, yeah
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more, no more
No, no, no!Tthink you see me in the glass?
Think you hear me?  Better listen fast
Think I see you, gone to seed
I hear your reason is built on greed

You're out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever, alright

You're a financial wizard, yeah, a top tycoon
You're a sweet long lizard with a silver spoon
You've never had it quite so good
You didn't know that you even could

Your time has come to own
Your touch turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever, alright

Been a long time, been a long, long wait
You caught your fingers in the pearly gates
You better leave your number and we'll call you
You know your problem ain't exactly new

Your time has come today
Your face turned away
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever, that's rightI was a Green Beret in Vietnam.
I said no more of your fairy stories
Cause I got my other worries.

Chorus:
53rd & 3rd
Standing on the street.
53rd & 3rd
I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd 
You're the one they never pick.
53rd & 3rd 
Don't it make you feel sick?

If you think you can well, Come on man,
I was a Green Beret in Vietnam.
I said no more of your fairy stories
Cause I got my other worries.

Chorus:
53rd & 3rd
Standing on the street.

I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd 
You're the one they never pick.
53rd & 3rd 
Don't it make you feel sick?

Then I took out my razor blade.
Then I did what God forbade.
Now the cops are after me.
But I proved that I am no sissy.

Chorus:
53rd & 3rd
Standing on the street.
53rd & 3rd
I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd 
You're the one they never pick.

Don't it make you feel sick?

Yo, whoa, yeahPower wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Apathy their stepping stone so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity so deceiving
Through your eyes, their light burns hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Lady Justice has been raped, truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips, now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again, make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell, cannot feel

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us

Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so realPeople think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify
Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too lateTempting you and all the earth to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one you people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate to pull you down into this pit

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins, the end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out and they always shall obey
Follow me now my child, not the meek or the mild but do just as I say

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

Jump by your will or be taken by force, I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit, I am stalking you as prey

Never hunger, never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within, triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends 
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Birth of terror, death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings, spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Into ruin, I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free, flooded, I'll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, Hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
My self is after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me, hahahahaOut of my day

No more nights in this eternal hell
Destination is simple, we move out

 Move up to the line
 Your turn to kill
 What do you say?
 I'm killing time

And he knew what was needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, it's kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he'll take your life

The silence is over, the attack's began
Killing and hatred drive you insane
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message received, we're moving back

 Move up to the line
 Your turn to kill
 What do you say?
 I'm killing time

The sound of gunfire comes through the night
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message received, we're moving back

And he knew what was needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, it's kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he'll take your life

 Move up to the line
 Your turn to kill
 What do you say?
 I'm killing timeWhat don't kill ya, make you more strong
You rise, you fall, you're down then you rise again
What don't kill ya, make you more strong

Rise, fall down, rise again
What don't kill ya, make you more strong
Rise, fall down, rise again
What don't kill ya, make you more strong

Through black days, through black nights
Through pitch black insights

Breaking your teeth on the hard life a-comin'
(Show your scars)
Cutting your feet on the hard earth a-runnin'
(Show your scars)
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
But we die hard

The dawn, the death, the fight to the final breath
What don't kill ya, make you more strong
The dawn, the death, the fight to the final breath
What don't kill ya, make you more strong

Dawn, death, fight final breath
What don't kill ya, make you more strong
Dawn, death, fight final breath
What don't kill ya, make you more strong

They scratch me, they scrape me
They cut and rape me

Breaking your teeth on the hard life a-comin'

Cutting your feet on the hard earth a-runnin'
(Show your scars)
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
But we die hard

Breaking your teeth on the hard life a-comin'
(Show your scars)
Cutting your feet on the hard earth a-runnin'
(Show your scars)
Braiding your soul in a hard luck story
(Show your scars)
Spilling your blood in a hot sun's foray
(Show your scars)

Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
We die hard
We die hard
We die hardYou might find them

Pay no mind to the distant thunder
New day fills his head with wonder, boy

Says it feels right this time
Turned it 'round, and found the right line
"Good day to be alive, sir"
"Good day to be alive," he said, yeah

Then it comes to be that the soothing light
At the end of your tunnel
Was just a freight train coming your way

And the poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me

I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street
You walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes hard
And makes it cry

There's a dirty needle in your child
Haha, stick me
Empty bottles still in hand, still dead
Still me

I'm the suit and tie that bleeds the street
And still wants more
I'm the forty-five that's in your mouth
I'm a dirty, dirty whore

Yeah, look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you wanna see

Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me

Yeah, he wants to become father now
Me again, me
The marks inside your arms
Spell me, spell only me

I'm the nothing face that plants a bomb
And strolls away
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right
As children play

Yeah, look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look it's me
When no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you wanna see

Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me
It's me

Look up to me
What you've been and what you've feared
Look up to me
Look it's me, what you hear

See right through me
See the one who can't be free
See right through me
Look it's me, what no one wants to see

Hey, hey, hey

Hmm, now see the black cloud overhead
That's me
Hmm, in this poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me

And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street
You walk on by
And I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes
Makes it cry

Yeah, look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, hey, look it's me
When no one wants to see

Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me

See right though me
Look up to me
See right though me
Look up to meWhen the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

When you are the ostracized
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes
Twisting of the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Venom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile vein
Internalize and decimate
Patronize and complicate

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

Judas lives, recite this vow
I've become your new God now

Followed you from dawn of time
Whispered thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured your children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown

In the heart of feeble man
Plant the seeds of my own plan
The strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all
Inside you all

So bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kissI run but it stays right by my side

So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays, now it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me

Until it sleeps
(Until it sleeps)
(Until it sleeps)

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed
Don't want it

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you

Until it sleeps


I don't want it, no
Don't want it, want it, want it, no

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me till I'm clean

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps


Until it sleepsOpposition - Contradiction
Premonition - Compromise
Agitation - Violation
Masturbation... On our face
Darkest color: Blistered Earth... True death of life

[Frayed Ends of Sanity: Verse 1]
Never hunger - Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure...
Struggle within triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends...

[And Justice For All: Verse 1]
Halls of Justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of Justice crushes you, overpower

[AJFA: Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

[AJFA: Chorus]
Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone
Pulling your strings... Justice is done
Seeking no truth - Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[AJFA: Verse 2]
Apathy, their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden, deep animosity, so deceiving
Thru your eyes, their light burns, hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

[AJFA: Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

[AJFA: Chorus]
Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone
Pulling your strings... Justice is done
Seeking no truth - Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[Blackened: Verse 1]
Blackened is the end - Winter it will send
Throwing all you see into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth - Never a rebirth
Evolution's end - Never will it mend... Never

[Blackened: Chorus]
Fire, to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

[Blackened: Chorus (alt)]
Fire is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of Humanity
Color our world blackened!  Blackened!Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"

Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"

Scream from my soul
Fate mystified
Hell forever more
Scream from my soul
Fate mystified
Hell forever more

No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"
Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"Feel those things you do
In your eyes, I see a fire that burns
To free the you, that's wanting through
Deep inside, you know: seeds I plant, will grow

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance
That's right, let's dance

Snake! I am the snake!
Tempting that bite you take
Let me make your mind
Leave yourself behind! Be not afraid
I've got what you need: hunger, I will feed

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me, yeah
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance
Ha-ha! Come dance
Yeah, come dancin'

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance

Yeah!  I feel you too!
Feel those things you do
In your eyes, I see a fire that burns
To free the you, that's wanting through
Deep inside, you know: seeds I plant, will grow

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance
That's right, let's dance
H'mm, it's nice to see you here, ha-ha!I'm not expecting people anymore
Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor
Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale

Had a friend once in a room,
Had a good time, but it ended much too soon
In a cold month in that room
We found a reason for the things we had to do

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man, now my room is cold
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul

Yeah yeah
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder taleSmall-town boy, big-time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way

The streets are red, red I'm afraid
There's no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But, oh my God, how it all did change

Now they all pray
"Blood stains, wash away"

He said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

I heard him, he said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

I always said something's wrong
With little strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles

"Gallow calls, son," I say
"Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change"

Now they all pray
"Blood stains, wash away"

He said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

Yeah I heard him, he said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

Yeah, well all the green things died when Ronnie moved to this place
He said, "Don't you dare ask why I'm cursed to wear this face."
Well now we all know why the children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket they'd all fall down, down, down

He said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

Yeah, yeah I heard him, he screamed
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

That's right
All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today

Yeah, run along
All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun todayRow after row
Stone without soul
Or sorrow

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you call, my, name

Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermore

Crow the lonely crow
I think he knows
I'm lonely too
So lonely

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you call, my, name

Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermore

Is that rain or are they tears
That stain this concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding all
It's fall to winter
Back to fall

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel lit right down
Upon the new stone with my name
It's peace at last
Oh, peace at last

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you call, my, name

Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermoreYou better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground

Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes
No, the sunshine never comes

Push you 'cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your time

God I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
In this prison

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison

And I will wait no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear. The sun will shine
This, I swear
This, I swear
This sun will shineThere's someone else controlling me
Death in the air, strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me

Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you"?

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat chilling cold as I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend

My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Someone help me, oh please God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Someone help me, oh please God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Time moving slow, the minutes seem like hours
The final curtain all I see
How true is this? Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be

Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flameThat gather up the magnets
Set before me

I attract you and repel you
A science of the heart
And blood and meaning

The coldness of most beauties
Is a challenge that our youth
Must quickly conquer

There is no time for guilt
Or second guessing, second guessing
Based on feeling

I am the truth, the beauty
That causes you to cross
Your sacred boundaries

I have no morals
Some think me cheap
And someone who despises
The normalcy of heartbreak
The purity of love

But I worship the young
And just formed angel

Who sits upon the pin of lust
Everything else
Bores me

I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up
Your life of reason
I want you on the floor
And in a coffin your soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed
Like a fortune

Oh throw it away
For worship someone
Who actively despises you

For worship someone
Who actively despises you

I am the root
I am the progress
I'm the aggressor
I am the tablet
These ten stories

Worship
Worship

Pain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
I offer them to you as servants
Of the gold that you must give

Pain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
And I'll offer them, I offer them to you
As servants of the gold
That you must give to me

I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up, give it up
Your your life of reason

I want to see you on the floor

And in a coffin, soul shaking
Soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed
Like a fortune, like a fortune
Throw it away

For worship of someone
Who actively despises you

Who actively despises you.Would I use them to get back on track?
Stop to warm at karma's burning
Or look ahead, but keep on turning?
 
Do I have the strength
To know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?
 
Could I have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?

Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place is the means to your end
Touch it, feel it
Green hell

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from it?
I bet you thought you really could

We're gonna burn in hell
Green hell
Like every hell but kind of green
Green hell, green hell
Try let me get back up there
Green hell, green hell
Feel it burning in your cereal
Green hell, green hell
Throw our fuckin' friends inside
Green hell, green hell
Gotta fuckin' pay and you must stay
Green hell, green hell
Cannot refill the torch of death
Green hell, green hell
Hell is reigning in your blood
Green hell, green hell
Gotta burn it all
Green hell

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
Did you run away from me?
I bet you thought you really could
You've come to this as someone told
I bet you never knew you would
Gonna bring
Green hellTruth is an offense
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must

Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself, and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom's ring

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I sayDie die die, my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die die die, my darling
Just shut your pretty eyes
I'll be seein' you again
Yeah, I'll be seein' you in Hell

So, don't cry to me, oh baby
Your future's in an oblong box
Don't cry to me, oh baby
You should have seen it comin' on
Don't cry to me, oh baby
Had to know it was in your cards
Don't cry to me, oh baby
Dead-end soul, for a dead-end girl
Don't cry to me, oh baby
And now your life drains on that floor
Don't cry to me, oh baby

Die die die, my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die die die, my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth
I'll be seein' you again
I'll be seein' you in Hell

Don't cry to me, oh baby
Your future's in an oblong box
Don't cry to me, oh baby
You should have seen it comin' on
Don't cry to me, oh baby
Had to know it was in your cards
Don't cry to me, oh baby
Dead-end soul, for a dead-end girl
Don't cry to me, oh baby
And now your life drains on that floor
Don't cry to me, oh baby

Die die die, my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die die die, my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth
I'll be seein' you again
Yeah, I'll be seein' you in Hell

Die die die

DieDeath Angel's kiss
Brings final bliss
Completely

Empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Ooh, call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Wait, wait patiently
Your death-black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o'er me

Empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Ooh, call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Say, is that rain or are they tears
That stained your concrete face for years?
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel laid right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last, oh, peace at last

Ooh, empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Forevermore
Forevermore
It's just the funeral I've been waiting forOut at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reasons tend to fly away

Like lesser birds on the four winds, yeah
Like silver scrapes in May
Now the sand's become a crust
And most of you have gone away, then you're gone away

Ah, come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you want to know where winds come from

Well, it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the Four Winds Bar
Mmm, yeah

Yeah
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Four winds at the four winds bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door left to take you in
The other one just mirrors it

Hey
Hey
Yeah, hey
Yeah, hey

Ooh, in hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Never warms
Never warms

The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear
Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar

It's a nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me

Yo, hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Call me Desdenova
Eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
Hey, and don't forget my dog
Fixed and consequent

Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me

I have a passionate heart
It can tear us apart
I have the loves of many men
But I don't love any of them

Why do I cheat on me

You have your feelings
I have mine
I spit upon you and change my mind
I have many hearts to break
And many, many, many more to take

Let the light of stars pour out
Like a candle in a spout
Let the wick recede and break
Let the starlight radiate
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I desecrate me
Why do I piss my dreams
That's because that's what it is

I have the drive
I got the scope
If I, if I, if I, could I give you a rope

Your love means zero to me
I'm a passionate-less wave upon the sea
Passionate-less wave upon the sea
Why, why, why
Do you cheat on me

Oh why, do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on myself
Well I got nobody else

I'm only young once
I want to taste it all and have fun
I have no real feelings in my soul
Where most have passion I got a hole
I really got nobody else

I want lovers like the rain
So many of them, so much the same
You say you love me, I know it's true
But I, I, I don't love you

Why do I cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me
Your love means zero to me
A passionate-less wave
Your love means zero to me.It's time to save your world

Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure

Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling

He could just be gone
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive?
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This sinking life, outside it's hell
Inside intoxicating

He's run aground like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast, down with his ship
Fading in the shadows

Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive?
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?

Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive?
So how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?But what the hell is this world coming to?

Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

We all shall die

Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire

Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am

As I watched my mother die, I lost my head
Revenge now I sought to break with my bread
Taking no chances, you come with me
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

Am I evil? Yes I am

I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man

I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire
You can come with me, sweet desire
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man

My soul is longing for, await my heir
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man

Am I evil? Yes I fucking am
Am I evil? I am man, yeahFor I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within

And when I'm branded
This mark of shame
Should I look down disgraced
Or straight ahead
And know that you must blame

I am, I am the secret
I am, I am the sin
I am, I am the guilty
And I, I am the thorn within

Forgive me, father
For I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within

So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you
One and the same are we

I am, I am the secret
I am, I am the sin
I am, I am the guilty
And I, I am the thorn within

I do your time
I take your fall
I'm branded guilty for us all

So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you
One and the same are we

But it's all too much

Invisible kid
Locked away in his brain
From the shame and the pain
World down the drain

Invisible kid
Suspicious of your touch
Don't want no crutch
But it's all too much

I hide inside, I hurt inside
I hide inside but I'll show you...

I'm okay, just go away
Into distance, let me fade
I'm okay, just go away
I'm okay, but please don't stray too far

Open your heart, I'm beating right here
Open your mind, I'm being right here (Right now)
Open your heart, I'm beating right here
Open your mind, I'm being right here (Right now)

Invisible kid
Never see what he did
Got stuck where he hid
Fallen through the grid

Invisible kid
Got a place of his own
Where he'll never be known
Inward he's grown

Invisible kid
Never see what he did
Got stuck where he hid
Fallen through the grid

Invisible kid
Got a place of his own
Where he'll never be known
Inward he's grown

I hide inside, I hurt inside
I hide inside but I'll show you...

I'm okay, just go away
Into distance let me fade
I'm okay, (I'm okay) just go away
I'm okay, (I'm okay) but please don't stray too far

Open your heart, I'm beating right here
Open your mind, I'm being right here (Right now)
Open your heart, I'm beating right here
Open your mind, I'm being right here (Right now)

Ooh, what a good boy you are
Out of the way and you've kept to yourself
Ooh, can't you see that he's not here
He doesn't want the attention you give
Ooh, unplugging from it all
Invisible kid floats alone in his room
Ooh, what a quiet boy you are
He looks so calm floating 'round and around in himself

Invisible kid
Locked away in his brain
From the shame and the pain
World down the drain

Invisible kid
Suspicious of your touch
Don't want no crutch
But it's all too much

Open your mind, I'm being right here (Right now)
Open your heart, I'm beating right here
Open your mind, I'm being right here (Right now)Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops with me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Now the world is gone I'm just one
Oh God help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me

Darkness
Imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hellWe do our best, you're the rest, you make it real, you know
There's a feeling deep inside that drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead, you need it oh so bad

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!

Bang your head against the stage like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore
In a frenzied madness with your leather and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around, it's hot as hell tonight

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!

Here on the stage the Marshalls' noise is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kick your face, exploding feeling nears
Now's the time to let it rip, to let it fuckin' loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill, 'cause this is what we choose

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

Here we go!

Whiplash!

The show is through, the metal's gone, it's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig, again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways, life out here is raw
But we'll never stop, we'll never quit, 'cause we're Metallica

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniacAnd quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules

With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

You labeled me
I'll label you
So I dub thee unforgiven

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

You labeled me
I'll label you
So I dub thee unforgiven

Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgivenDolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sin

So you lay us in a line
Push your pins, they make us humble
Only you can tell, in time,
If we fall or merely stumble

But tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away, so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free,
You jab another pin, jab another pin in me

Yeah...
Mirror, mirror upon thy wall
Break this spell or become the doll

See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us,
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time the needles turn from shine to rust

But tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away, so we may start again?

Tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free,
Jab another pin, jab another pin in me...
Jab it... ("Here come the pins")

Blood for face, sweat for dirt
Three X's for the stone
To break this curse, a ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone

Shell of shotgun, pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith which way we can
To fall in love with life again

To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love, to fall in love
To fall in love with life again

So tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away, so we may start again?

Yeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done,
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free,
Jab another pin, jab another pin in me
Yeah-eh-eh-h'eah

No more pins in me, yeah
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more, no more
No, no, no!Tthink you see me in the glass?
Think you hear me?  Better listen fast
Think I see you, gone to seed
I hear your reason is built on greed

You're out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever, alright

You're a financial wizard, yeah, a top tycoon
You're a sweet long lizard with a silver spoon
You've never had it quite so good
You didn't know that you even could

Your time has come to own
Your touch turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever, alright

Been a long time, been a long, long wait
You caught your fingers in the pearly gates
You better leave your number and we'll call you
You know your problem ain't exactly new

Your time has come today
Your face turned away
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever, that's rightI was a Green Beret in Vietnam.
I said no more of your fairy stories
Cause I got my other worries.

Chorus:
53rd & 3rd
Standing on the street.
53rd & 3rd
I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd 
You're the one they never pick.
53rd & 3rd 
Don't it make you feel sick?

If you think you can well, Come on man,
I was a Green Beret in Vietnam.
I said no more of your fairy stories
Cause I got my other worries.

Chorus:

I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd 
You're the one they never pick.
53rd & 3rd 
Don't it make you feel sick?

Then I took out my razor blade.
Then I did what God forbade.
Now the cops are after me.
But I proved that I am no sissy.

Chorus:
53rd & 3rd
Standing on the street.
53rd & 3rd
I'm trying to turn a trick.
53rd & 3rd 
You're the one they never pick.

Yo, whoa, yeahPower wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Apathy their stepping stone so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity so deceiving
Through your eyes, their light burns hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Lady Justice has been raped, truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips, now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again, make your deal
Just what is truth? I cannot tell, cannot feel

The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price we pay
Nothing can save us

Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so realPeople think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify
Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too lateTempting you and all the earth to join our sinful kind
There is a job to be done and I'm the one you people make me do it
Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate to pull you down into this pit

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins, the end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man and from their souls within
My disciples all shout to search you out and they always shall obey
Follow me now my child, not the meek or the mild but do just as I say

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

Jump by your will or be taken by force, I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit, I am stalking you as prey

Never hunger, never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within, triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends 
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Birth of terror, death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings, spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

Into ruin, I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free, flooded, I'll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, Hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression

Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
My self is after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me, hahahahaOut of my day

You might blind themOn his crash course with the big time
Pay no mind to the distant thunder

Says it feels right this time
Turned it 'round, and found the right line
"Good day to be alive, sir"
"Good day to be alive," he said, yeah

And the poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me

I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street
You walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes hard
And makes it cry

There's a dirty needle in your child
Haha, stick me
Empty bottles still in hand, still dead
Still me

I'm the suit and tie that bleeds the street
And still wants more
I'm the forty-five that's in your mouth
I'm a dirty, dirty whore

Yeah, look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look it's me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you wanna see

Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me

Yeah, he wants to become father now
Me again, me
The marks inside your arms
Spell me, spell only me

I'm the nothing face that plants a bomb
And strolls away
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right
As children play

Yeah, look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look it's me
When no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you wanna see

Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me
It's me

Look up to me
What you've been and what you've feared
Look up to me
Look it's me, what you hear

See right through me
See the one who can't be free
See right through me
Look it's me, what no one wants to see

Hey, hey, hey

Hmm, now see the black cloud overhead
That's me
Hmm, in this poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me

And I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street
You walk on by
And I'm the little boy that pushes, pushes
Makes it cry

Yeah, look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, hey, look it's me
When no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you wanna see

Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me
Yeah
It's me

Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me

See right though me
Look up to me
See right though me
Look up to meWhen the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

When you are the ostracized
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes
Twisting of the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Venom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile vein
Internalize and decimate
Patronize and complicate

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss

Judas lives, recite this vow
I've become your new God now

Followed you from dawn of time
Whispered thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured your children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown

In the heart of feeble man
Plant the seeds of my own plan
The strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all
Inside you all

So bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kissI run but it stays right by my side

So tear me open, pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays, now it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me

Until it sleeps
(Until it sleeps)
(Until it sleeps)

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed
Don't want it

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you

Until it sleeps


I don't want it, no
Don't want it, want it, want it, no

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me till I'm clean

I'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps


Until it sleepsOpposition - Contradiction
Premonition - Compromise
Agitation - Violation
Masturbation... On our face
Darkest color: Blistered Earth... True death of life

[Frayed Ends of Sanity: Verse 1]
Never hunger - Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure...
Struggle within triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends...

[And Justice For All: Verse 1]
Halls of Justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of Justice crushes you, overpower

[AJFA: Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

[AJFA: Chorus]
Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone
Pulling your strings... Justice is done
Seeking no truth - Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[AJFA: Verse 2]
Apathy, their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden, deep animosity, so deceiving
Thru your eyes, their light burns, hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds

[AJFA: Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price you pay
Nothing can save you

[AJFA: Chorus]
Justice is lost - Justice is raped - Justice is gone
Pulling your strings... Justice is done
Seeking no truth - Winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[Blackened: Verse 1]
Blackened is the end - Winter it will send
Throwing all you see into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth - Never a rebirth
Evolution's end - Never will it mend... Never

[Blackened: Chorus]
Fire, to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

[Blackened: Chorus (alt)]
Fire is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of Humanity
Color our world blackened!  Blackened!Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymore

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"

Crystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I say

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"

Scream from my soul
Fate mystified
Hell forever more
Scream from my soul
Fate mystified
Hell forever more

No release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me

Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"
Freezing, can't move at all
Screaming, can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out, "I'm trapped under ice"Feel those things you do
In your eyes, I see a fire that burns
To free the you, that's wanting through
Deep inside, you know: seeds I plant, will grow

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance
That's right, let's dance

Snake! I am the snake!
Tempting that bite you take
Let me make your mind
Leave yourself behind! Be not afraid
I've got what you need: hunger, I will feed

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me, yeah
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance
Ha-ha! Come dance
Yeah, come dancin'

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance

Yeah!  I feel you too!
Feel those things you do
In your eyes, I see a fire that burns
To free the you, that's wanting through
Deep inside, you know: seeds I plant, will grow

One day, you will see
And dare to come down to me 
Yeah, come on, come on, now, take the chance
That's right, let's dance
H'mm, it's nice to see you here, ha-ha!I'm not expecting people anymore
Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor
Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale

Had a friend once in a room,
Had a good time, but it ended much too soon
In a cold month in that room
We found a reason for the things we had to do

I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man, now my room is cold
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul

Yeah yeah
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder taleSmall-town boy, big-time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way

The streets are red, red I'm afraid
There's no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But, oh my God, how it all did change

Now they all pray
"Blood stains, wash away"

He said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

I heard him, he said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

I always said something's wrong
With little strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles

"Gallow calls, son," I say
"Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change"

Now they all pray
"Blood stains, wash away"

He said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

Yeah I heard him, he said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

Yeah, well all the green things died when Ronnie moved to this place
He said, "Don't you dare ask why I'm cursed to wear this face."
Well now we all know why the children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket they'd all fall down, down, down

He said
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"

Yeah, yeah I heard him, he screamed
"Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way"
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

That's right
All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today

Yeah, run along
All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun todayRow after row
Stone without soul
Or sorrow

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you call, my, name

Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermore

Crow the lonely crow
I think he knows
I'm lonely too
So lonely

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you call, my, name

Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermore

Is that rain or are they tears
That stain this concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding all
It's fall to winter
Back to fall

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel lit right down
Upon the new stone with my name
It's peace at last
Oh, peace at last

Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you let, me, stay
Empty, are they?
DEATH, Won't you call, my, name

Angelhead, I'm already dead
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
Angelface, Mother full of grace
Touch me so we'll be together, forever
And ever, and evermoreYou better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground

Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes
No, the sunshine never comes

Push you 'cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your time

God I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
In this prison

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison

And I will wait no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear. The sun will shine
This, I swear
This, I swear
This sun will shineThere's someone else controlling me
Death in the air, strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me

Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you"?

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat chilling cold as I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend

My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flame

Someone help me, oh please God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Someone help me, oh please God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Time moving slow, the minutes seem like hours
The final curtain all I see
How true is this? Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be

Wakened by horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flameThat gather up the magnets
Set before me

I attract you and repel you
A science of the heart
And blood and meaning

The coldness of most beauties
Is a challenge that our youth
Must quickly conquer

There is no time for guilt
Or second guessing, second guessing
Based on feeling

I am the truth, the beauty
That causes you to cross
Your sacred boundaries

I have no morals
Some think me cheap
And someone who despises
The normalcy of heartbreak
The purity of love

But I worship the young
And just formed angel

Who sits upon the pin of lust
Everything else
Bores me

I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up
Your life of reason
I want you on the floor
And in a coffin your soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed
Like a fortune

Oh throw it away
For worship someone
Who actively despises you

For worship someone
Who actively despises you

I am the root
I am the progress
I'm the aggressor
I am the tablet
These ten stories

Worship
Worship

Pain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
I offer them to you as servants
Of the gold that you must give

Pain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
And I'll offer them, I offer them to you
As servants of the gold
That you must give to me

I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up, give it up
Your your life of reason

I want to see you on the floor

And in a coffin, soul shaking
Soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed
Like a fortune, like a fortune
Throw it away

For worship of someone
Who actively despises you

Who actively despises you.Would I use them to get back on track?
Stop to warm at karma's burning
Or look ahead, but keep on turning?
 
Do I have the strength
To know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?
 
Could I have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?

Here in this place lies the key to your death
Touch it, see it
Here in this place is the means to your end
Touch it, feel it
Green hell

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
And did you run away from it?
I bet you thought you really could

We're gonna burn in hell
Green hell
Like every hell but kind of green
Green hell, green hell
Try let me get back up there
Green hell, green hell
Feel it burning in your cereal
Green hell, green hell
Throw our fuckin' friends inside

Gotta fuckin' pay and you must stay
Green hell, green hell
Cannot refill the torch of death
Green hell, green hell
Hell is reigning in your blood

You did your best as someone could
I bet you never knew you would
Did you run away from me?
I bet you thought you really could
You've come to this as someone told
I bet you never knew you would
Gonna bring
Green hellTruth is an offense
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must

Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself, and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom's ring

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I sayDie die die, my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die die die, my darling
Just shut your pretty eyes

Yeah, I'll be seein' you in Hell

So, don't cry to me, oh baby
Your future's in an oblong box
Don't cry to me, oh baby

Brings final bliss
Completely

Empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Ooh, call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Wait, wait patiently
Your death-black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o'er me

Empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Ooh, call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Say, is that rain or are they tears
That stained your concrete face for years?
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel laid right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last, oh, peace at last

Ooh, empty, they say
"Death, won't you let me stay?"
Empty, they say
"Death, hear me call your name!"
Call your name

Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Forevermore
Forevermore
It's just the funeral I've been waiting forOut at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reasons tend to fly away

Like lesser birds on the four winds, yeah
Like silver scrapes in May
Now the sand's become a crust
And most of you have gone away, then you're gone away

Ah, come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you want to know where winds come from

Well, it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the Four Winds Bar
Mmm, yeah

Yeah
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey

Four winds at the four winds bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door left to take you in
The other one just mirrors it

Hey
Hey
Yeah, hey
Yeah, hey

Ooh, in hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Never warms
Never warms

The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear
Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar

It's a nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me

Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me

I have a passionate heart
It can tear us apart
I have the loves of many men
But I don't love any of them

Why do I cheat on me

You have your feelings
I have mine
I spit upon you and change my mind
I have many hearts to break
And many, many, many more to take

Let the light of stars pour out
Like a candle in a spout
Let the wick recede and break
Let the starlight radiate
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I desecrate me
Why do I piss my dreams
That's because that's what it is

I have the drive
I got the scope
If I, if I, if I, could I give you a rope

Your love means zero to me
I'm a passionate-less wave upon the sea
Passionate-less wave upon the sea
Why, why, why
Do you cheat on me
Why, why, why
Do I cheat on thee
Oh why, do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on myself
Well I got nobody else

I'm only young once
I want to taste it all and have fun
I have no real feelings in my soul
Where most have passion I got a hole
I really got nobody else

I want lovers like the rain
So many of them, so much the same
You say you love me, I know it's true
But I, I, I don't love you

Why do I cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me
Your love means zero to me
A passionate-less wave
Your love means zero to me.It's time to save your world

Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure

Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling

He could just be gone
He would just sail on
He'll just sail on

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive?
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This sinking life, outside it's hell
Inside intoxicating

He's run aground like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast, down with his ship
Fading in the shadows

Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive?
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?

Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

How can I be lost
In remembrance I relive?
So how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?But what the hell is this world coming to?

Blow the universe into nothingness
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

We all shall die

Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast
Armageddon's here, like said in the past

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

Soon to fill our lungs, the hot winds of death
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath

Fight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear

Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire, fight fire with fire

Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am

As I watched my mother die, I lost my head
Revenge now I sought to break with my bread
Taking no chances, you come with me
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice
Gotta see 'em, make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am

I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man

I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire
You can come with me, sweet desire
My face is long forgot, my face not my own
Sweet and timely whore, take me home

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man

My soul is longing for, await my heir
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself

Sweet and timely whore, take me home

Am I evil? Yes I am
Am I evil? I am man

Am I evil? Yes I fucking am
Am I evil? I am man, yeahFor I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within

And when I'm branded
This mark of shame
Should I look down disgraced
Or straight ahead
And know that you must blame

I am, I am the secret
I am, I am the sin
I am, I am the guilty
And I, I am the thorn within

Forgive me, father
For I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within

So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you
One and the same are we

I am, I am the secret
I am, I am the sin
I am, I am the guilty
And I, I am the thorn within

I do your time
I take your fall
I'm branded guilty for us all

So point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you
One and the same are we

I am, I am your secrets

I am, I am your guilty
And I, I am the thorn within

Do as you say
Not as you do
You're pushing me to a breakpoint
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint

Self esteem you seem to lack

Bad times are contagious
You laugh and infect

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint

Watching pain is your only pleasure
Sick fascination for someone's disaster
Self suffering since you were born
Mess with the bull and you'll get the horn
Misery, the word that fits
Can't seem to smile till someone's sad

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me, push, push me
Push, push, push me to a breakpoint

In my opinions as a professional, I recommend
We straightjacket the son-of-a-bitch
Lock him in a rubber room
Sedate him, heavily
And when he wakes up
If he wakes up, we'll see
If he can be a nice boy

Well... I don't know... it's gonna hurt me
More that it's gonna hurt him

Let's do it!

You push me to a breakpoint, breakpoint
Push me to a breakpoint, breakpoint
Don't push me, you piece of shitFor me there is no exemption 
I started praying 

I heard the voice of satisfaction 
Needing me for benefaction 
I started pleading 

I heard the bells begin to chime 
Warning me oh lord 
Don't let this be my time 
Don't let this be my time 

I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire 
I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher 
When nothing fits and nothing seems right 
Till the very last breath of my life, I'll be there for you 

You saw me slide, you saw me fall 
We kept our pride through it all 
We started screaming 

When skies are dark, no sun shines through 
I know I see the light in you 
We stopped dreaming and started believing 

I'll be there for you, when you walk through the fire 
I'll be there for you, when the flames get higher 
When nothing fits and nothing seems right 
Till the very last breath of my life, I'll be there for you 
I'll be there 

In my hour of need 
You were there always 
Now it's time for me to be there for you too 
Always 

I'll be there for youSands in the hourglass fall for us all
You don't answer me anymore when I call
So much is trapped inside, tangled in your brain
It's getting cold outside and it looks like rain
The sky is falling and my heart is caving in

So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye
The setting of the sun reflection in your eyes
Day after day after day the world will pass you by,
you forget to remember

Solo - Dave

If this is living, what the hell is living for?
You've boarded up your eyes, your mind has locked the door
I'm just a stranger now with an unfamiliar face
You can't recall me at all, 
there's not a trace... not a trace... not a trace
I don't know where you are and my world is crumbling in

So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye
The setting of the sun reflection in your eyes
Day after day after day the world will pass you by,
you forget to remember

Solo - Chris

I just want to talk - What do you want?
But you've nothing to say - Leave me alone
I beg you to come - Get away from me
And you just walk away - I have no idea who you are!
I curse the day that your smile fades away, till then I pray

A burning candle in-between and at both ends
With all that we've learned, yet we still pretend
I just wish you could say my name again

They made the lock and broke the key, 
the culprit was the mercury
The vaccine wipes your memories, 
till you forget even how to breathe
A tangled web they weave, when they practice to deceive

So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye
The setting of the sun reflection in your eyes
Day after day after day the world will pass you by
I said that I'd be strong, but you know I had to lie

You forget to remember... it's time to say the long goodbyeHow much shame, do you have to conceal.
There is no sunshine, just endless nights.
Nobody's there, nobody cares when you cry.

Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.

When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.

How many secrets, do you keep inside?
How many sins, do you have to hide?
The haunting masses, have blackened the sun.
You'll pay for everything you've done
One by one.

Is it my face you see?
Do I mock you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.

When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.

Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.

When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.

Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.
When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.

Monkey on my back, aching in my bones
I forgot you said, "One day you'll walk alone"
I said I need you, does that make me wrong?
Am I a weak man, are you feeling strong?
My heart was blackened, it's bloody red
A hole in my heart, a hole in my head?

Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?
In a dream I cannot see
Tangled abstract fallacy
Random turmoil builds in me
I'm addicted
Addicted to chaos

Lights shined on my path, turn bad days into good
Turn breakdowns into blocks, I smashed 'em 'cause I could
My brain was labored, my head would spin
Don't let me down, don't give up, don't give in
The rain comes down, cold wind blows
The plans we made are back up on the road
Turn up my collar, welcome the unknown
Remember that you said, "One day you'll walk alone"

Your daddy is a wino, and your mommy is quite insane 
From altar boy to sewer rate, you don't give a damn 
Your sister's a junkie, gets "it" anyway she can 
Your brother's a gay singer in a stud leather band 
Your girlfriend's got herpes to go with your help and AIDS 
There ain't one person you know you ain't ripped off yet 

Look deep in the mirror, look deep into its eyes 
Your face is replaced, a creature you despise 
But I know what you're made of, it ain't much I'm afraid 
I know you'll be lying until your dying day 

Make up your stories, the truth's so hard to say 
Brain is numb and your tongue will surely dig your grave 
Your mind is sickly from Alzheimer's Disease 
And decadence and debauchery killed your memories 

You're a liar, liar, liar, everyone can see 
You're a liar, liar, it's all you'll ever be

You shake loose by stuffing your brains
Winning, sinning, beginning, feeding, the needing for bleeding
Bashing, smashing, crashing, fraying, annihilating you

There's someone back in the shadows
You feel though you can't see his eyes
He'll bash your head if you cross him
Ain't quite your average guy

You'd better believe itSomewhere shortly past nine AM
The armored car they wanted to heist wasn't coming
So instead they went for the bank

The fateful duo that sat in the get-away car
Heavily sedated with thousands of rounds
Armor piercing, fully automatic weapons
The bowls of wrath poured out on the ground

Baptized in a firefight, hot blood running cold as ice
Forty-four minutes of target practice, all hell's breaking loose
Outgunned, watching "The Force"
Come to a firefight with a pocketknife
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel
And brought down the beast

This was an accident waiting to happen
It wasn't IF it would happen, it was WHEN
The city's people sabotaged themselves
Calling their firepower an unneeded expense

The two most violent men it seemed couldn't be stopped
Standard police issue guns were just not enough
But SWAT arrived and settled the fight
Between AK-47 and AR-15

Baptized in a firefight, hot blood running cold as ice
Forty-four minutes of target practice, all hell's breaking loose
Outgunned, watching "The Force"
Come to a firefight with a pocketknife
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel
And brought down the beast

Baptized in a firefight, hot blood running cold as ice
Forty-four minutes of target practice, all hell's breaking loose
Outgunned, watching "The Force"
Come to a firefight with a pocketknife
Getting schooled until they shot Achilles' heel
And brought down the beastAnd I ain't superstitious as I break the looking glass
Ain't afraid of no demons, don't make me laugh, haha
I ain't superstitious, under the ladder I go
And I ain't superstitious, it's all bullshit, don't you know?
I ain't afraid of no shadows, I like the dark anyway
And that's a fact, ha

Superstitious
Superstitious

And I ain't superstitious, no such thing as bad luck
And I ain't superstitious, I couldn't really give a fuck
Take your stupid superstitions, find some other paranoidal
Chickenshit, sissy, worm, and tell it to him

Superstitious
Superstitious

I ain't superstitious
I ain't superstitious

And that's a fact, one more time
Come on, shut your mouth
Listen up, hey it's my turnLeaping from the sky
Hurling through the air
Exhilarating high
See the earth below
Soon to make a crater
Blue sky, black death
I'm off to meet my maker

Energy of the gods, adrenalin surge
Won't stop till I hit the ground
I'm on my way for sure
Up here in the air, this will never hurt
I'm on my way to impact
Taste the high speed dirt

Paralyzed with fear
Feel velocity gain
Entering a near-catatonic state
Pressure of the sound
Roaring through my head
Crash into the ground
Damned if I'll be dead

Energy of the gods, adrenalin surge
Won't stop till I hit the ground
I'm on my way for sure
Up here in the air, this will never hurt
I'm on my way to impact
Taste the high speed dirt

Jump or die!

Dropping all my weight
Going down full throttle
The pale horse awaits
Like a genie in a bottle
Fire in my veins
Faster as I go
I forgot my name
I'm a dirt torpedo

High speed dirt
High speed dirt
High speed dirt
High speed dirt
High speed dirt
High speed dirt
High speed dirt
High speed dirtIn the ever expanding world
Of nuclear attacks and global destruction
An invisable circle of silence
Errupts inside your abdomen
Eye to eye no one speaks
Who will be more obsecure
Evil lingers around us
And no one seeks to destroys us
Prepare for interrogation
With the immaculate nucleus 
With imminent imaginations
Through the magic of fascination

Do not go outside the invisable door
'Cause nobody else seems to disappear
As long as all of us are there
Throughout the wear and tear
Of dreams past and present

Here we are on the planet Evilville
Put your head above the sky and detonate
All your phantom fears and all of your dangers that might kill
And why do I the power, however
To destroy our destiny
And the power to overcome this buzzkill
Comes from underneath the earth

Do not go outside the invisable door
'Cause nobody else seems to disappear
As long as all of us are there
Throughout the wear and tear
Of dreams past and presentMultiple personalities
Inside the screams were deafening
Outside the silent agony

Curses coming down
A maelstrom of plagues

Medieval as Merlin
A pact for power was made
Mephistophelian transaction
A virgin soul, the price was paid

Scouring the days
The vortex of pain

A telestic message to you all
Written in torment
Howl out your dirges
Like a sonic blast
Distorted faces twisting in rage
Butt you head against the horns of the ram
You're tortured to appease[]But I'll be back someday
And as I fly away
My hope is that we'll meet again
I'm off to my home away from home
I will miss you
But I know
I know you know

I'm coming home to Arizona
I'm coming home to Arizona

I'll take you everywhere I go
I'll show you everything I see
And as we say so long
I know your tears wish me well
It won't be long till I'm back again
We will meet again
We will meet again
You will see, oh

I'm coming home to Arizona
I'm coming homeThere'll be no tomorrow
Beginning of Sorrow

Easy prey, so innocent
She barely was a teen
Hooked up with Mr. Right now
A nightmare that stole her dreams
Complications come
The Doctor says you gotta know
You decide if the baby lives
But one of you has got to go

The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow, There'll be no tomorrow
The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow

Brought forth in agony
This life was misbegot
Born in an alleyway
A child nobody will adopt
Delinquent in a foster home
His heart is so full of rage
His first name's "Ward"
His last name is "Of the State"

Origo doloris non erit crastinus dies

Like father, like son
Soon he gets revenge
Two souls soon become one
The vicious cycle never ends
Unwanted, unloved
He lives now just to hate
From the pain of being born
And nothing can take that away

The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow, There'll be no tomorrow
The Beginning of Sorrow, Beginning of Sorrow
There will be no tomorrow...Step up now, you're in for a ride

Yeah right!

I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
'Til they got a hold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see

I got no friends 'cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm gettin' real shot down
And I'm feeling mean

No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene

I'm not hard to get along with...
Ha! I'm impossible!

I got no friends 'cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm gettin' real shot down
And I'm feeling mean

No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene

My dog bit me on the leg today
My cat clawed my eye
Mom's been thrown out of the social circle
And Dad's had to hide
I went to church incognito
And everybody rose
The Reverend Smith, he recognized me
And punched me in the nose, he said

No more
Nice guy
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene
No more Mister Nice Guy
No more Mister Clean
No more Mister Nice Guy
They say he's sick, he's obscene, oh yeah

Never said I was that nice in the first place, you know?Take a midnight stroll with me?
Through the misty air the things
I keep I shouldn't dare

My garden's so inviting, and its
Deadly blooms are hiding
Be careful what you touch
Lest the grave is what you lust

Draw the blinds, you're getting tired
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares
From the Deadly Nightshade

Each night at midnight
Dating back into the fog of time
Another victim falls
The things I've done; the voices call

The Hourglass runs out on us
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
The killers must be fed, the soil is red
Now that you're dead

Draw the blinds, you're getting tired
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares
From the Deadly Nightshade

Delirium – your burning throat
Mania – your heart rate soars
Hallucination – you're losing your mind
Suffocation – cannot breathe; you're going blind

Draw the blinds, you're getting tired
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares
From the Deadly Nightshade"November 1, 2552 A.D. The spaceship Evilzone arrives on Nuquledom, a bizar-
re planet located 600 billion miles, 10 and a half to the equator... sinist-
er forces abide by moonlight as scientists devise plots to detonate human desires and brutality amongst space travelers in the best interest of the solar system... In the darkest regions of dark space, slayers, offenders and
alien abductors are taking over Nuquledom, having slain humans and extrater-
restrial beings by stalking brains and facing fear amongst the farest areas
of this dreadful plante, the torture affecting their fate will be destroyed
by sinister extraterrestrial masterminds - eventually destroying the whole
planet, not only by chance, but by nuclear annihilation."

"As the solar system evolves into one curiosity-conscious force of death,
the end of the world will take place for 3,450 years and 2,700 centuries...
forcing Nuquledom on certain areas of attack... for billions of weeks, days
and months."

And now, the destruction of Nuquledom begins.

II. 2552 Overture (Instrumental)(20-minute version)

III. Truce Over Agony

Death and darkness are all around this planet
Everytime the planet explodes quickly in a future time
For each bullet of plutonium being hit there
Evil is the enemy of indestructible decline
For this is the kingdom and we are the troubleshooters
Truce over agony will reign again - forever

Our society changes constantly
Torture is within life's hidden reach
This time, extraterrestrials turn head around the earth
And continue turning them around without terminal breach
For this is the kingdom and we are the troubleshooters
Truce over agony will reign again - forever

IV. The Cranial Clock

"To think, the planet Nuquledom has evolved into an indestructible village
- a world of the extraterrestrial underground where human and other adversa-
ries attack. As I enter the experimental intergalatic development center...
known as the National Association for Planetary Research... My partner in planetary combat has completed the development of a experimental space trav-
el adventure policy. He tells me when this scheme happens over the next few
years as scientists and mercenaries began the 52,000-week intergalatic batt-
leground. What the sciensts come up with will be the creation of the crani-
al clock."

"As the battle for control of the Ideatric System begins in honest, the
destruction of Nuquledom is carried out by the forces of evil... the wrath
of Nuquledom will be completed in 52,000 weeks; death is surrounded by the
inquisities of the National Association for Planetary Research by hard ways - doing everything the interrogators have in their power to survive."

Most often, by the sinister forces of evil in Nuquledom
Having performed their random acts of brutal distraction
What matters most likely, should they destroy the entire planet of life
No one is safe because of galatiic annihilation

We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil
What we have done in our battle for semantic freedom
We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil

Just stare at the interplanetary man
He gives each man a helping hand
Join in the Brothership of Mind Control
And attack each other by slamming intergalactic windfall

We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil
What we have done in our battle for semantic freedom
We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil

Pessimism is falling as time slips away
Every space travel is being implanted with a computer chip
The travails of hell is as vital as it is brutal
No attention contact within every day

IIV. Interrogation Conspiracy Trap

"In June of 2553, the National Association for Planetary Research is em-
barking on a plan to detonate Nuquledom, as spaceship pilots continue their
battle for semantic combat during the first year of the annihilation of the
planet."

"For the slayers of human bodies, alien invaders attack the psychological
mystique found deep inside the realm of death. Nuquledom's commander in chief, Rex Nuclear, Ph.D., devises an early warning conspiracy that allows
Nuquledom to be blown up piecemeal within the next few decades."

V. Death Kills The Planet

"Even now distraction erupts again as the forces of danger dangle along
Nuquledom and the 25 planets of the Ideatric System by detonating all areas
of this dreadful community of extraterrestrial life. In the kingdom of inde-
structiveness, torture, death and greed subside in harmony as the annihilat-
ion of Nuquledom continues in the year 2557."

"What happens to visitors when they land on Nuquledom will see a great deal
of intergalatic fears and brutal straits of hell. I must oppose the abductor
and the scientist battling for control of the Ideatric System; and the fears
concerning Nuquledom are in flux as troubleshooters duke their traits of hell as the senses of sight, taste, hearing and touching coexsist."

"Let the destruction of the Ideatric System continue..."

Shoot the laws of gravity in space
Shoot stars directing interplanetary grace
Go after the darkness in the galaxy
Destroy all inhuman thought and reveal the alien enemy
Know what space travelers believe in humanity
What happens to the planetary straits affecting our society

Shoot back at torture and run all fear around
Not for the sake of heart, making for the last guy abound
Shoot back at the enemy behind enemy lines
Heating up controversy concerning inhuman decline
Under attack, slayers have been executed
Not by force, but by abduction
Face your intergalatic fears, vying to face destruction

VI. 2552 Overture (15-Minute Finale)Hydraulics on the move
Kicking in my face
Savage bucking mule

Pummeling my soul
One hundred tons of lead
Trampled under foot
Steamrollers on my head

Crushing down, caving in
My will to live
I'd rather be dead
Scream insane
To have the bullprick
Split their guts
Make them pay, make them bleed
On your back, in your face
Down your throat, up your ass
Bullprick

Pulverizing flesh
Broken bones the aftermath
Can't escape the war
The war machine path

All become one
Flattening the streets
Cry for absolution
Splitting at the seams

Crushing down, caving in
My will to live
I'd rather be dead
Scream insane
To have the bullprick
Split their guts
Make them pay, make them bleed
On your back, in your face
Down your throat, up your ass
BullprickI'll have one more yesterday
Take life from tomorrow
'Cause I've burned out my today

If I get up to the top I know
I'll just go back downhill
Got a terminal future
And it's time to write my will

Down another glass of courage
And a shot of thorazine

We're not ready to see you yet
Ninety-nine ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet

Got a short between the earphones
Wringing my hands in dismay
A more efficient maniac
With two feet in the grave

I ain't got no last words to say
Yellow streak right up my spine
The gun in my mouth was real
And the taste blew my mind

In a black tie and straight jacket
Man, I'm gonna try again

We're not ready to see you yet
Ninety-nine ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet

Demitasse of arsenic
Try on this tie
Never mind the tree

There is only death and danger
In the sockets of my eyes
A playground of illusion
No one plays, they only die

There's a prison in my mind
And the bars are gonna break
I'm as mad as a hatter
And strung out just the same

Taunting rigor mortis
I feel it draw me in

We're not ready to see you yet
Ninety-nine ways to die
We're not ready to see you yetMy body's soaked in a cold, cold sweat 
I reenact the lurid scenes 
And clawed engravings in my head 

Oh, I can't punch hard enough and I run 
I can't kick high enough and I run 
I can't shoot straight enough and I run 
I can't hold on enough and I run 
Oh, I can't stay down enough and I run 
I can't take pain enough and I run 
I can't bleed fast enough 
I can't die dead enough 

The air is thick, but the oxygen's thin 
My heart is beating like a drum, boom! 
And ice is flowing through my veins 
Explosives on my lips and in my lungs 

Oh, I can't punch hard enough and I run 
I can't kick high enough and I run 
I can't shoot straight enough and I run 
I can't hold on enough and I run 
Oh, I can't stay down enough and I run 
I can't take pain enough and I run 
I can't bleed fast enough 
I can't die dead enough 

I don't know what I'm running from 
And I don't know where I'm running to 
There's something deep and strange inside of me I see 

I don't know what I'm running from 
And I don't know where I'm running to 
Something's compelling me to run into the dark 

And now I am more driven than before 
And now I live just to settle score 
And now I feel the nearness of your breath 
Now I introduce you to your death 
Solo- Poland 
Solo- Mustaine 
Solo- Poland 

I am more driven than before 
I live just to settle score 
I feel the nearness of your breath 
I introduce you to your death 
I can't punch hard enough 
I can't kick high enough 
I can't shoot straight enough 
I can't hold on enough 

I can't stay down enough, (die dead enough) 
I can't take pain enough, (die dead enough) 
I can't bleed fast enough, (die dead enough) 
I can't die dead enough, (die dead enough)I like to go
Everyone is there
But their face don't show
If you get inside
You can't get out
There's no coming back
I hear them shout

Welcome to my hide away, my secret place
How I arrived I can't explain
You're welcome to, if you want to stay
But everyone just runs away
Oh

There's a secret place
I like to go
Everyone is there
But their face don't show
If you get inside
You can't get out
There's no coming back
I hear them shout

Let me in
Get me out
Can't do more than twist and shout
Lost my soul without a trace
Found it again in my secret place
Let me in
Get me out
Can't do more than twist and shout
Lost my soul without a trace
In disgrace

I hide from those
That try to find me
Scary things
That's right behind me
I lost myself
I must confess
I can't explain
How I got in this mess

Welcome to my hide away, my secret place
How I arrived I can't explain
You're welcome to, if you want to stay
But everyone just runs away

(My secret place) There's a secret place
(My secret place) There's a secret place
I like to go
(My secret place) There's a secret place
I like to go
Just runs away
My secret placeIt was just another fight
It was words strung into sentences
It was doomed to not be right

There is something wrong with me
There is something wrong with you
There is nothing left of us
There is one thing I can do

Lying on your bed,
Examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch
I throw the switch
Somewhere an electric chair awaits
Hey! This was my life
Hey! This was my fate

This was the wrong thing to do
This was the wrong one to be doing
This was the road to destiny
This was the road to my ruin

Now there's motives for the suspect
Now there's nothing left to say
Now there's method to the madness
Now there's society to pay

Lying on your bed
Examining my head
This is the part of me that hates
Paybacks are a bitch
I throw the switch
Somewhere an electric chair awaits
Hey! This was my life
Hey! This was my fate

In our life there is if
In our beliefs there's lie
In our business there is s-s-sin
In our bodies there is die

This was my life
This was my fate
This was my life
This was my fateFor the things I commit each night in my head
Like last night in my sleep, I got to snuff you
But then I woke up again, safe in my little bed

No one is safe
When I close my eyes
I come to take your life

I get to force your untimely disappearance
Each night in my dreams, when I'm fast asleep
I close my eyes and you just vanish
Soon as I lay down my head, when I'm dead to the whole wide world

No one is safe
When I close my eyes
I come to take your life

And then I wake up again
And it was all just a dream
And everything is the same

(Sleepwalker) Did I give you concrete shoes
And throw your body off of a bridge?
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep, pray your soul is mine to keep
I feel you near me
(Go to sleep... Go to sleep... Go to sleep...)
(Sleepwalker)
(Go to sleep... Go to sleep... Go to sleep...)

Just taking a stroll...
Don't go to sleep!
Here's some toothpicks for your eyes!

You always make an excellent cadaver
I roll up your body in a carpet to make music
In the trunk of my limousine, wrapped up in a rug
A fitting end is that I send you up the river like a punk

No one is safe
When I close my eyes
I come to take your life

The angel of death is pissed off at me again
Just because I got to put you out of my misery
It doesn't matter, I am without fear
Now that you're dead, I won't shed another bloody tear for you

No one is safe
When I close my eyes
I come to take your life

I'm calling down the thunder
Then you'll sleep with the fishes
The answer to all of my wishes

(Sleepwalker) Did I tell you I was in movies
Then dump you garotted, lying naked in a ditch?
(Sleepwalker) Everyday, another way
I know you can hear me

I think you'd look nice in a Colombian necktie
Should stop your tongue from wagging the dog
No more stupidity from you, as I pull your tongue through
For a smile from ear to ear, now there's nothing to hear

No one is safe
When I close my eyes
I come to take your life

And then I wake up again
And it was all just a dream
And everything is still the same

(Sleepwalker) Did I give you concrete shoes
And throw your body off of a bridge?
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep, pray your soul is mine to keep
I feel you near me
(Sleepwalker) Or did I tell you I was in movies
Then dump you garotted, lying naked in a ditch?
(Sleepwalker) Everyday, another way
I know you can hear me
(Sleepwalker) Did I buy you the farm?
Put a horse head in your bed?
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep, pray your soul is mine to keep
I feel you near me
(Sleepwalker) Everyday
Everyday, another way
(Sleepwalker) When I lay down to sleep, pray your soul is mine to keep
I know you can hear me
(Sleepwalker)
(Sleepwalker)
(Sleepwalker)Something's gone wrong 
Nowhere do I belong 
I listen to the voices in the dark room 

Something's going down 
But I can't make a sound 
Looking past the bars of my mind 

The coat of arms falling 
I hear the doctor calling 
The family crest is falling 
I hear the doctor calling 

Always sharing trips 
Remove me from your lips 
Sight and mind still and never go away 

One too many tantrums 
Deviated symptoms 
Better lock the phantom away 

The coat of arms falling 
I hear the doctor calling 
The family crest is falling 
I hear the doctor calling 
I see the chalkline crawling 
I hear the doctor calling me away 

This place is my home 
My mind still runs free 
The doctor's prescription 
Less for you and more for me 

The coat of arms falling 
I hear the doctor calling 
The family crest is falling 
I hear the doctor calling 
I see the chalkline crawling 
I hear the doctor calling me away 
A merciful embalming 
I hear the doctor calling me awayWithin the human race
Eliminate the poor
How much longer will it take?
Burning up the tents
Of the rank and file
Exterminate their lives
Crack a demon smile

Crushing down
Caving in
Our will to live
Getting rid
Of man's mistakes
To take a lost life
Lock it up, break it down, how much more can we take?

Fight for freedom
Fight authority
Fight for anything
My country 'tis of me

Cry for absolution
It's not the end for me
A last-minute pardon
One final reprieve
Resist the war machine
Don't get in its path
Fight to die a free man
And reap the aftermath

Crushing down
Caving in
Our will to live
Getting rid
Of man's mistakes
To take a lost life
Lock it up, break it down, I don't know how much more I can take

Fight for freedom
Fight authority
Fight for anything
My country 'tis of me



Fight for freedom
Fight authority
Fight for anything
It's my country
Fight for freedom
Fight authority
Fight for anything
My country 'tis of meNo one likes when it fits
So we tell soothing lies
And betray our own lips

The uncivilized world
And its people decay
Once sweet breeze is defiled
Sucking our breath away

Stole a car and I'm on the run
through the night to the rising sun
And the trouble has just begun

Roses on your grave

Watch the authorities come undone
With every standoff that I’ve won
Flirting death is just for fun

Public enemy number one
Born a fugitive father’s son
Another heist of a bank is done

Revelation has come to pass
New world order, will hold the mass

A book written by the man
Used to control and command
All rights will be denied
Without the mark you shall die

No confession, all is known  (All is known)
New world order, you shall be shown  (Shall be shown)

Monitoring all wages
New world order comes in stages
Currency is obsolete
Feel the agony of defeat

Symbol of society today
A must have or you shall pay
As humans flesh leads the mind
Just as a pawn the last martyr dies

No confession, all is known  (All is known)
New world order, you shall be shown  (Shall be shown)

Where hath the apostles gone?
Joining hands with wicked ones

Looking through the night Using infra-red
My target on you Aimed at your head

$10.000 up front $10.000 when I'm through
And I know just what to do And ya know I'll do it too
Then I'm coming back for you Back for you

I do the "getting rid of"
Don't tell me why
Don't need to hear the truth
Don't need the lies
Now pay me quickly
And now we're through
It brings me great pleasure
To say my next job is you
Don't you know that
Killing is my business
And business is good
You'd better believe itOn the truth and the lie
All rise, court's in session
We'll hang someone high

Justice means nothing today
Now that the courts are for sale
Pick a crime from the menu; pick a sentence and defend you
And pay the down payment called bail
The system's for sale

Kick the chair, the ropes tight
Just like one quick wrench, the tooth is out
Friend or foe, i gotta hang 'em dead
Or they'll come back around
Kick it!

The court's wrong when it keeps track
Of victories and defeats
The press that never rest just waits
For someone's soul they can eat

Justice means nothing today
Now that the jury's for sale
Guilty or not, the verdict's a lie
You're going to jail
The system has failed

Kick the chair, the ropes tight
Just like one quick wrench, the tooth is out
Friend or foe, ya gotta hang 'em dead
Or they'll come back 

*guitar solos til end*This is breaking news
It appears that Air Force One was shot down
Somewhere over the Middle East this morning
By a sleeper cell of rogue terrorists firing a Stinger Missile
The Pilot and all passengers are unaccounted for
The President's whereabouts are presently unknown and he is presumed missing
The Vice President, Secretary of State, and principals of the military are assembling
Our nation stands at DEFCON 3

The greatest crisis, will someone come for me?
I "red, white and blew it"
Unleashed revenge, my body is detained
How could anybody do this?

Betrayal, I peel away the days
Medals are useless, Uncle Sam's forgotten me
I'm not important, no one will ever come
I'll never be found, God get me out of this hell

Nuclear battlefields energized
Cold wars are heating up again
The tensions mounting
People lift up your fists in revenge

The stage is set
Who will be the first to blink?
We can't go to war
Remember that "Vietnam thing"

Peace at any price
With a gun to your head, bang, bang
Weakness runs in your family
What runs in mine is death

This is your 5 minute warning
Burn all of your classified documents
And if cooler heads don't prevail
First strike from a political dead man

Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive
He understands only one language - action
And he respects only one word - force
No sign of them stopping, no time for back channel communiques
We need all the help we can get, air strikes and invasions, retaliate, I say!

The will of good men can not counter the terrible strain of war

Blackmail the universe with the greatest of calamities
Awaken those sleeping giants in the dust of the ground
With their skin destroyed, unjust to innocence
Lawful possessor of the world's last 24 hours

Terror and ugliness reveal what death really means
And in hatred you see men as they really are
If chosen over heaven, Earth will have been for them
All along, only another region of hellLeaving me unfulfilled 
Promising compromise 
Championing mediocrity

Time and time again 
What you said ain't what you mean 
Even if all my bones are broken 
I will drag myself back from the edge to

Kill the King, the King is dead, long live the King 
Kill the King, the King is dead, long live the King, 
I am the King, God save the King

Kill the King, the King is dead 
I am the King, long live the King 
Kill the King, the King is dead 
I am the King, long live the King

I reveal a deceiver 
In the highest seat in the land 
His idle hands the Devil's workshop 
Generate more smoke than heat

Time and time again 
What you said ain't what you mean 
Even if all my bones are broken 
I will drag myself back from the edge to

Kill the King, the King is dead, long live the King 
Kill the King, the King is dead, long live the King, 
I am the King, God save the King

Kill the King, the King is dead 
I am the King, long live the King 
Kill the King, the King is dead 
I am the King, long live the King

A new precedent in pain, a new precedent in pain 
Mankind is blown to dust, mankind is blown to dust
An explosion of the Brain, an explosion of the Brain
Spontaneously combust, spontaneously combust

Kill the King, the King is dead,

My wants are all I care
No shame or guilt, there's nothing there
Look deep into my face
I sell deceit without a trace
Fear not what I can do
Unless you want it done to you
Oh oh!

As I climb onto your back, I will promise does not sting
I will tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion
Oh!

My self I'm centered in
There's nothing else, there's never been
And I dream, to be left alone
With the sadness, the madness of my own
Look deep into my soul
It's black as coal like a bullet hole
Fear not, get off your knees
There's no defense, you'll do what I please
Oh!

As I climb onto your back, I will promise does not sting
I will tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
Then I treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know that I am a scorpion
Oh!

As I climb onto your back, I will promise does not sting
I will tell you what you want to hear, and not mean anything
I will treat you like a dog as I shoot my venom in
'Cause you knew all along that I am a scorpion, ya!

My lies, to reach the shore
I aggrandize and nothing more
My hopes, to steal away
All that you love, I'll soon betray
Look deep into my past
The pain I deal is unsurpassed
I'm not a lowly scorpion
I'm so much worse; I'm the fall of man

Fighting broke out overnight between rival factions along the
Israeli/Syrian border. Initial reports say Israeli jet fighters
bombed the guerrilla base killing at least 49 soldiers and 13 civilians

A 49 year old unidentified man went berserk last night
opening fire with a 12 gauge shotgun in a crowded downtown
restaurant. 14 people are dead including 3 children

A crackdown on laboratory experiments on animals is expected
to become law today. Animal rights activists have been
pushing for the bill for 9 years and have taken part in mass demonstrations throughout the nation.

Police have smashed a multi million dollar drug smuggling
ring. 22 pounds of heroin was seized along with a small
amount of cocaine, marijuana, and hashish. 25 people have
been arrested and face charges ranging from smuggling to
possession for the purpose of trafficking.That , and I was hung like a martyr

The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask you're wearing rips

But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities

Engaged in crime, I grasp my throat
Enraged, my mind starts to smoke
Enforced mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry, ow!

And when the story takes a twist
It folds like a contortionist
Sleight of hand and a quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged

Engaged in crime, I grasp my throat
Enraged, my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry

The searing of the sinew
My body fights for air
The ripping of tissue
My lungs begin to tear
Gravity's got my bones
It pulls my flesh away
The steam finally dissipates
I make out my sweating face

Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture its jaw to let me be

A cut-out cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber-hosed the air

Engaged in crime, I grasp my throat
Enraged, my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry again
And again and again, again

Engaged in crime, I grasp my throat
Enraged, my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry, ow!I feel a familiar pain
It seems like years since we've loved
Or even liked and that's a lonely way to be

Drifting alone in a sea of agony
Your face I can't recognize
Don't make this hard on us
I will miss you if you just go away

I did no right you did no wrong
Nothing left but wasted days
I regret you leaving
But I will never take you back

You know what? It's over
I just don't feel the same way as I used to
We've been together forever, but it's over

Goodbye 1000 times goodbye
The thought never crossed my mind
That this would be my last goodbye
Let me put pennies on your eyes
And kiss your lips one last goodbye
My love 1000 times goodbye

It seems nothing good is free
A good thing cost much more than the price
You were good but not that good
Don't kid yourself now it's time to break up

Drifting alone in a sea of agony
Your face I can't recognize
Don't make this hard on us
I will miss you if you just go away

I did no right you did no wrong
Nothing left but wasted days
I regret you leaving
But I'll never take you back

Don't call me anymore. It's just not'
I don't feel the same way about you
Its not as good as it used to be

Goodbye 1000 times goodbye
The thought never crossed my mind
That this would be my last goodbye
Let me put pennies on your eyes
And kiss your lips one last goodbye
My love 1000 times goodbye

I'll always love you but just not like that
Like what?
I want to be honest with you I met someone else
You did what?
And I really, I really love him like I used to love you
Remember the time that I told you that
I was going out of town for business?
Well I went to see him
You know what? You suck!

Goodbye 1000 times
You'll always have a special place
In my heart you know that
It's just I can't be with you anymore it's over
Goodbye 1000 times
Things may not work out with him
Goodbye 1000 times
And if they don't
Goodbye 1000 times
Then I'll certainly call you
Goodbye 1000 times
You mean a lot to me
I still really want to be friends with you
I love you like you're my brotherHe didn't want to end up like them

And now he blames the voices of a toothless wonder

Pounding on the door to make the next score

Anything for a hit, any sin to pay for it
For that next bowl, he'd sell his soul

Spiral to destruction, it's too late to break the spell
He wants the ride to stop on the freight train straight to hell
Without the truth he'll never find in a dungeon of his lies
His cause of death...high speed on burnt ice

Always looking at the ground, a broken beaten man
Memories of his family are calling after him
He can hardly think, hardly walk
Phone keeps ringing, he can't talk
With just one hit the pain would go away
But he's dead if he does

Shadow people follow him everywhere he goes
Looking over his shoulder, the paranoia growsWhen things were good I know you would always be there for me
Yes, It's true; friends like you are few and far between
I wish I may, I wish I might, the things you do ain't quite right
Just ain't right

And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend
Don't turn your back...

Solo - Chris

Solo - Dave

When things were bad you always had something else better to do
It's just a lie to think that I could ever mean anything to you
You steal what's mine then help me look for it;
how many times do I pay for it? How many times?

And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend

And still we try to pretend
That you will be here in the end
The best advice that I can lend
Don't ever turn your back on a friend

Don't turn your back...

Impossible to break these walls
For you see, the steel is much too strong
Computer banks to rule the world
Instruments to sight the stars

Possibly, I've seen too much
Hangar 18, I know too much

Foreign life forms inventory
Suspended state of cryogenics
Selective amnesia's the story
Believed foretold but who'd suspect
The military intelligence
Two words combined that can't make sense

Possibly, I've seen too much
Hangar 18, I know too muchWhy things go like they do
Somewhere there's a reason
Why some things just fall through
We don't always see them
For what they really are
But I know there's a reason,
Just can't see it from this far

Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice
Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice

I thought I knew it all 
I thought I had it made 
How could it end this way? 
I thought I knew, oh
I thought I knew, oh

Somewhere there's a reason
Why things don't go my way
Somewhere there's a reason
That I cannot explain
Just like the change of seasons
Just may not be my turn
But I know there's a reason
The lesson's mine to learn

Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice
Maybe I don't like it, but I have no choice
I know that somewhere, someone hears my voice

I thought I knew it all 
I thought I had it made 
How could it end this way?

How could it end this way? 
I thought I knew, oh
I thought I knew, oh

I thought I knew it all
But I knew
But I knew
But I knew
But I knew
But I knew
But I knew
But I knew
But I knew it allA feeling in my soul
I hyperventilate as I accelerate
Till I've lost all control

My speed becomes relentless
Contesting all my senses
White line appearing faster
Prompting death and disaster

My supersonic machine
Get out of my…

Fast lane, like a jet plane
Like a freight train, I'm driving insane
Addicted to the fast lane
Rushing to my brain
No time to explain, this is my domain
Addicted to the fast lane

I look into mirror, red lights are drawing nearer
They think I've met my match
But I shift into high gear, soon they just disappear
You can't jail what you can't catch

My speed becomes relentless
Contesting all my senses
White line appearing faster
Prompting death and disaster

I hear the engines screaming
I'm burning up the… 

Fast lane, like a jet plane
Like a freight train, I'm driving insane
Addicted to the fast lane
Rushing to my brain
No time to explain, this is my domain
Fast lane

Fast lane, like a jet plane
Like a freight train, this is my domain
Addicted to the fast laneFrom faring heavy loads
And the soldiers liberate them
Laying mines along their roads
Sorrow paid for valor 
Is too much to recall
Of the countless corpses piled up 
Along the wailing wall

Melting down all metals
Turning plows and shears to swords
Shun words of the Bible
We need implements of war
Chalklines and red puddles 
Of those who have been slain
Destiny, that crooked schemer
Says the dead shall rise... Again!

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy!

Now we've rewritten history
The one thing we've found out
Sweet taste of vindication
It turns to ashes in your mouth

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy!

If you're fighting to live
It's O.K. to die!
The answer to your question is...
Welcome to tomorrow!

Where do we go from here?
God have mercy!

Where do we go from here?
And should we really care?
The end is finally here
God have mercy!My sweet lord
Mmmm my lord
Mmmm my lord

I really wanna see you
I really wanna live with you
I really wanna see you
But it takes so long, my lord

Buenos Aires, mmm my lord
Buenos Aires, uhh my lord
Buenos Aires, mmm my lord
Buenos Aires, mmm

[Uninteligible] miss you
I really wanna live here
We really fucking love you
Argentina rules
But it wont take long my lord

Argentina
Argentina
Argentina
Buenos Aires

(Good bye, muchísimas gracias, adiós)That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 

Back when I was just seventeen 
I thought that I knew everything 
I could make it in this scene 
To be a rising star that only gleamed 
But all the answers disagreed 
With the questions held for me 

I was legal now at twenty-one 
I knew the way the world should run 
My God just look what I had done 
Simply drunk and having fun 
Looked for friends, but I found none 
All alone at twenty-one 

The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 
The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 

At twenty-five I was surprised 
That I was still even half alive 
Somehow I managed to survive 
I felt my body's doing time 
And In my back a hundred knives 
From friends at twenty-five 

And now as Gabriel sounds my warning bell 
I'd buy your life, if you would sell 
A year or two, if less compelled 
So live your life and live it well 
There's not much left of me to tell 
I just got back up each time I fell 

The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 
The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 

The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 

The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 
The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and men 
The fire burns on and on 
That drives me on till all is gone 
Except the simple plans 
Of mice and menI am your ruler, land, sea and air
Immense in my girth, erect I stand tall
I am a nuclear murderer, I am Polaris
Ready to pounce at the touch of a button
My system locked in on military gluttons
I rule on land, air and sea
Pass judgement on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of hell
Will we give warning? Only time will tell
Satan rears his ugly head
To spit to the wind

I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death
Wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death
Wrestles your nostrils

Launch the Polaris
The end doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace

Bomb shelters filled to the brim
Survival, such a silly whim
World leaders sell missiles cheap
Your stomach turns, your flesh creeps
I rule on land, air and sea
Pass judgement on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of hell
Will we give warning? Only time will tell

I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death
Wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death
Wrestles your nostrils

Launch the Polaris
The end doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace

High priest of holocaust, fire from the sea
Nuclear winter spreading disease
The day of final conflict, all pay the price
The Third World War rapes peace, takes life
Back to the start, talk of the part
When the Earth was cold as ice
Total dismay as the sun passed away
And the days were black as night

I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death
Wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog
Discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death
Wrestles your nostrils

Launch the Polaris
The end doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace

PolarisBefore your journey begins underground
But not before we torment you from your cell
Straight to hell with a short detour in-between

Begging for mercy, all alone
Unable to handle the pressure
Before his mortification
Now let the torture begin

Death by the head crusher
Head crusher!
Death by the head crusher
Ow!

The horrific torture device
For those who fail interrogation
The most painful technique ever known
People thirst for the worst, the skull's disintegration

Beaten, broken, in bloody rags
Adding insult to injury, he recants
But it's much too late
Now let the torture begin

Death by the head crusher
Head crusher!
Death by the head crusher

On your knees, prisoner, take your position
Place your chin forward into the restraints
Your head slowly caves in from the compression
You faint in a blackout from the infernal pain

Twisting, turning the giant screw
Your teeth are breaking loose
Crushed and splintering into your mouth

Winding down, cutting through
Like broken glass being chewed
The fragmented skull and shattering bones
There's nothing you can doI am an Anti-Christ
And I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want, but I know how to get it
I want to destroy, possibly?

'Cause I want to be anarchy
No dog's body

Anarchy for the USA
It's coming sometime it maybe
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic light
Your future dream is a shopping spree

'Cause I want to be anarchy
In the city

Of many ways to get what you want
I use the best, I use the rest
I use the enemy
I use anarchy

'Cause I want to be anarchy
It's the only way to be

Is this the MPLA?
Is this the UDA?
Is this the IRA?
I thought it was the USA, or just another country
And other cunt-like tendencies
'Cause I want to be anarchy
'Cause I want to be anarchy
You know what I mean?

'Cause I want to be an anarchist
Again I'm pissed, destroy!Courthouse tan and beady eyes
A slouch with fallen arches
Purging truths into great lies
A little man with a big eraser
Changing history
Procedures that he's programmed to do
All he hears and sees
Altering the facts and figures
Events and every issue
Make a person disappear
And no one will ever miss you

Rewrites every story
Every poem that ever was
Eliminates incompetence
And those who break the laws
Follow the instructions of the New Ways' Evil Book of Rules
Replacing rights with wrongs
The files and records in the schools

You say you've got the answers
Well who asked you anyway?
Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way?
Don't try to fool us
We know the worst is yet to come
I believe my kingdom will come

F is for fighting
R is for red, ancestors' blood in battles they've shed
E we elect them
E we eject them, in the land of the free, and the home of the brave
D for dying
O your overture
M they will cover your grave with manure
This spells out freedom, it means nothing to me
As long as there's a P.M.R.C.

Pull the strings that make me work

Like a fish with hook in mouth

I'm not a fish

Hook in mouth!And now I reclaim this banner by God my sword and my name 
In a truce sealed by blood within this metal skin and all that I own 
Blood, bone, and courage in my veins and the heart that pumps it 

Drink from the chalice and be reborn 
And the land with me, it will change and transform 

A fighting man sworn to the quest it is the doom of man that they forget 
I have awoken the dragon and all around me the mist of his breath 
Good and evil, there never is one without the other, his brother 
Always there where I least expect it, it will burn me to cinders 

The futures taken root in the present sun 
Don't look into my heart, least of all your own 

No man who is false can win in combat against the truth 
When he lies he murders some part of the world, we must find what was lost 
Hearth and home, wife and child were not for me, I was not yet done 
I never knew how empty my soul was until it was refilled 

Mad distemper strikes both beggars and Kings 
The Necromancer's hard teachings of war and quest 

I am given the right to bear arms and power to meet justice 

I have lived through others for far too long, 
And carried my guilt, my causes, my sins 
I hope in the hereafter when I owe no more to the future 
That I can be just a manChasing shots of tequila, just about high noon
Outside Nuevo Laredo, deep in no man's land
Become a killer or be killed; face down in the Rio Grande

Poverty will turn the life of any good man bad
All love and mercy ever learned, he'll soon forget what he had

Guns, drugs, and money under the Mexican sky
Guns, drugs, and money; pick your poison or you die
Guns, drugs, and money; a pistol pressed to his head
Choose silver and you're rich; you gonna die if you choose lead

He had a suitcase full of money, plenty of ammo for his gun
The sweat rolls down his dirty face, his plans have all come undone
It's just a matter of time, no matter how hard he tries
He hears "Plata O Plomo, Gringo?" the last words before he dies

Poverty will turn the life of any good man bad
All love and mercy ever learned, he'll soon forget what he had

Guns, drugs, and money under the Mexican sky
Guns, drugs, and money; pick your poison or you die
Guns, drugs, and money; a pistol pressed to his head
Choose silver and you're rich; you gonna die if you choose lead

Guns, drugs, and money x4I woke up in a black FEMA box
Darkness was all around me, in my coffin
My dreams are all nightmares anymore
And this is what I dream every night

The leader of the New World Order, the President of the United States
Has declared anyone now residing inside the US of A
Without the RFID chip, you're just an illegal alien
An enemy combatant of America, welcome to the New World Order

This is the end of the road
This is the end of the line
This is the end of your life
This is the . . .

A society in a society, inside the fence life as you know it stops
They got their rules of conduct and we got ours
Be quick or be dead, you crumble up and die
The clock is ticking so slowly and so much can happen in an hour

This is the end of the road
This is the end of the line
This is the end of your life
This is the endgame

I learned my lessons the hard way, every scar I earned
I had to bleed, inside the day yard
A system of controlled movement, like a giant ant farm
Any time is long time, now you're not in charge of your time anymore

This is the end of the road
This is the end of the line
This is the end of your life
This is the end

The ex-President signed a secret bill that can
Land a legal US citizen in jail
And the Patriot Act stripped away our constitutional rights
They say a concentration camp just popped up, yeah, right!

Refuse the chip? Ha! Get persecute and beat
By the tyranny of mind control, for the mark of the beast
All rights removed, you're punished, captured, and enslaved
Believe me when I say, "This IS the Endgame!"I hear you've got a big mouth
Saying things you know aren't true
What the hell are you talking about?

So, now we have a conundrum
And the problem is clearly you
This is the part where it gets ugly
And the solution; getting rid of you

You'll never be safe in the shadows
I'll be waiting in the dark
With a shovel and a bag full of lime
I'll say the devil made me do it

I look who's talking and I see
A big nothing looking back at me
Mine is just to do or die, it's not to reason why
I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie

Don't you think I have friends besides you?
You called me out, you couldn't resist
I'll never stop until I find you
That's when you're gonna cease to exist

How stupid do you have to be?
To think the trail of evidence that you've left
Won't boomerang back in your face
To your moth-eaten brain by meth

Like the wolf that does not howl
Concealed and ready to attack
It's time to pay with your flesh
And you'll never stop me

I look who's talking and I see
A big nothing looking back at me
Mine is just to do or die, it's not to reason why
I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie

The dogs that bark the loudest are the dogs that have no teeth

I look who's talking and I see
A big nothing looking back at me
Mine is just to do or die, it's not to reason why
I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie

Look at you!
Look who's talking, a big nothing looking back at me
Would you look at you?
Look who's talking, a big nothing, that's all I see
Won't you look at you?
Look who's talking, a big nothing, it's what you mean to me
Oh, but you're never gonna be anything anyway
Now roll over and play deadWhen I said I need you
You stretched the truth
When you said that you knew
Just can't believe it
There's nothing to say
I was almost honest
Almost

Living alone
Can't stand this place
It's four in the morning
And I still see your face

I was nearly pure
When I said I loved you
You were semi-sincere
You said I'd bleed for you
We were kind of candid
Now you've gone away
You were almost honest
Almost

Living alone
Falling from grace
I want to atone
But there's just empty space
I can't face tomorrow (I can't face tomorrow)
Now you're not coming back (you're not coming back)
Walked off in the night (walked off in the night)
And just left me the tracks (and just left me the tracks)

I question the call
By the tone of your voice
I know I should hang up
But I don't have a choice

It happened that night
When you told me to go
Don't ask who's to blame
I don't know

Living alone (living alone)
Falling from grace (falling from grace)
I want to atone (I want to atone)
But there's just empty space (but there's just empty space)
I can't face tomorrow (I can't face tomorrow)
Now you're not coming back (now you're not coming back)
Walked off in the night (walked off in the night)
And just left me the tracks (and just left me the tracks)

(Almost) Almost honest
(Almost) I was almost honest
(Almost) I was almost honest

(Almost) Almost, almost honest
(Almost) Almost honest
(Almost) Almost honestWishing it will go away, but nothing's getting done
A shot heard 'round the world, when a mother's baby dies
We the people point our fingers, blame and wonder why

Hey
Hey
Hey

Face it and fight or turn high tail and run
'Til it comes back again just like the rising sun
Say they do all they can, it's just another lie
The answer's plain to see, nobody wants to try

Hey
Hey
Hey

Ooh, there's no recess and no rules in the school of life
If you listen very closely you'll see what it's like
Have cool, will travel

Ooh, there's no recess and no rules in the school of life
And if you listen very closely you'll see what it's like
Tell myself it ain't true, they just can't see
Grown up or sewn up, the medicines worse than the disease
Oh, Have cool, will travel
(Here we go) Have cool, will travel
Have cool, will travel!Everything's helter-skelter
Listen up! I warn you
Run for cover, run
Bang! It happened
Time's up, armageddon
Fire! Meltdown
The sky is crumbling in

Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtains

Escape? You're joking
Can't find no place to run
Hair is burning
My flesh is bubbling up
Blood is boiling
Taste copper on my tongue
Fate is coming
Welcome it with a smile

Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtains... Fall!
Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtains





Am I dreaming?
My heart pounds my chest
Held for ransom
In a spider's web
Suffocating
No one hears my calls
Neverending
Till the black curtain falls

Snakes surround me
Offering their death kiss to me
Down... I'm drowning
How long I'll hold my breath?
Dogs are chasing
My legs are paralyzed
Pray... don't find me
My life is fading fast

Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtains... Fall!
Black curtains
Neverending
Black curtainsDifferences don't exist in harmony!
Survival is superiority.
We don't need no hands across the sea!
We've got...

Foreign policy

The lines are drawn!
Establish the new order!
Suspect everyone
Know your enemies!
We've got...

Foreign policy

Hatred is purity!
Weakness is disease!
Where we bury you
It's manifest destiny!
We've got...

Foreign policyYou'll serve only me
And my will to kill
You will kill for me
All that I desire
All that I command
You are here for me
I'm your Master
My creation
I will make for you
A soul mate to love
Unlike your love for me
And you will take my name
She will be your bride
She will serve me too
And I will introduce to you
The Bride of FrankensteinTalk to each other become close
In a town much like a prison cell

People speak our names
On the street in hushed tones
Oh the stories they'd tell
If anyone would listen

You come from a town where
People don't bother saying hello
Unless somebody's born or dies

And I come from a place where they
Drag your hopes through the mud
Because their own dreams are all dying

And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
The sounds of the night should make us anxious
But it's much too late when the fear is gone

I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you
Where we can be together, I promise you
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you
I promise, I promise

There's so many fighting
To get past the Pearly Gates
But nobody ever wants to die or get saved

Their intentions aren't that good
And I can smell the asphalt
That's their personal road to hell being paved

And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
But it's much too late when the fear is gone

I will meet you in the Next Life, I promise you
Where we can be together, I promise you
I will wait till then in Heaven, I promise you
I promise, I promiseAnd my misfit's way of life
A dark, black past is my
Most valued possession
Hindsight is always twenty-twenty
But looking back, it's still a bit fuzzy
Speak of mutually assured destruction?
Nice story, tell it to Reader's Digest!

Feeling paranoid, true enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me and my air is getting thin
I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet
I'm chomping at the bit and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets

Hello me, it's me again
You can subdue, but never tame me
It gives me a migraine headache
Sinking down to your level
Yeah, just keep on thinking it's my fault
And stay an inch or two outta kicking distance
Mankind has got to know
Its limitations

Feeling claustrophobic, like the walls are closing in
Bloodstains on my hands and I don't know where I've been
I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet
I'm sharpening the axe and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets



Well me, it's nice talking to myself
A credit to dementia
Some day you too will know my pain
And smile its "black-tooth grin"
If the war inside my head
Won't take a day off, I'll be dead
My icy fingers claw your back
Here I come again!!!

Feeling paranoid, true enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me and my air is getting thin
Feeling claustrophobic like the walls are closing in
Bloodstains on my hands and I don't know where I've been

Once you committed me
Now you've acquitted me
Claiming validity
For your stupidity
I'm chomping at the bit
I'm sharpening the axe
Here I come again, oh-whoooa!
Sweating bulletsEthnic cleansing with no defending
These acts of genocide
A fatal ending with no surrendering
To cover up the crimes and lie

(Chorus)
Smart bombs, precision guided armament
A more sophisticated way to end up dead
Still we search and invent such intelligent weapons
That kill each other like the Gears of War

Gears of war... (x2)
Hoo-rah!!!
Gears of war... (x2)

When you ride with thieves, then you die with thieves
Cross my heart and hope that you die!
When the smoke has cleared, the devil's in the mirror
And you see his warheads paint the sky, now you die!

(Chorus)
Smart bombs, precision guided armament
A more sophisticated way to end up dead
Still we search and invent such intelligent weapons
That kill each other like the Gears of Waaaaaaaaaaaar

(Guitar Solo)Now you'll know why death was summoned here tonight
I'll recall my perils, they'll kill me in pride
No, I can't run away, there's no place to hide

Though too much to live for, I owe enough to die
Ask not for salvation, my death shall mean their lives
Hatred and guilt, the altar they've built, high priests of sin
Destiny, fate, the wicked one's gate beckoning you in
Down the walkways, through the blood stained town
Looking down the cross, bleeding from the crown
Led to stay to die besides the thieves
Kill the king of the world to be

And now to you, this will come
A putrifying pestilence
More noxious than the serpent's breath
Malevolently destined
More corrupt than the malice of choronzon
More diseased than the wind
Of the moonlight sun
Putrefaction you have caused
No need for confession
Now you wish you had a god to stop your demolition
Crushing the bones of the hundredfolds
Swinging the judgement hammer
Man, woman, child, no-one is safe
The heads of the dead are the banner

And this was all you got
So don these broken wings
Sands of time run out
Bells of Hades ring
Is this a nightmare
To unhallow thy name
Smell of brimstone
Dancing in the flames
No help now as you fulfill his task
Chief of evil has got you by the ass
Set free to sit upon the throne
Just a dream?
You're weeping all alone!

Looking down the cross
(Speak no evil)
I'm looking down the cross
(Speak no evil)Trouble is coming, hell on two wheels
Hide in the shadows awaiting defeat
Or live by the sword and choose to be free

We say retribution
We say vengeance is bliss
We say revolution
With a cast-iron fist

Coming down the road
Watching every move
Kicking in the door
Taking what we choose

Anarchy's coming to town
A fiery invader
Burning it down to the ground
The Disintegrators

We say retribution
We say vengeance is bliss
We say revolution
With a cast-iron fist

Coming down the road
Watching every move
Kicking in the doors
Taking what we choose

Anarchy's coming to town
A fiery invader
Burning it down to the ground
The Disintegrators

Anarchy's coming to town
A fiery invader
Burning it down to the ground
The Disintegrators

Anarchy's coming
Here it comes
Burning it down to the ground
Dis-in-tegratorsFeel a might unsteady but still I have to play
Six to one's the odds and we have the highest stakes
And once again I gamble with my very life today

Highly polished metal, the oil makes it gleam
Fill the terror chamber, your mind begins to scream
Your life is like a trigger, never trouble till you're squeezed
Now you crack a smile, as you give the gun a tease

Place the pistol down, now give the gun a spin
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in
A hateful way of vengeance, a bit of playful sin
Load another bullet, now the second round begins

A couple grains of powder, a couple grams of lead
A touch against the trigger, a touch inside the head
Take another drink and raise the last bets
Think about my last words, they might be what I just said

A click comes from the hammer that couldn't drive a nail
Sense the numbing cold blue or the red of Hades' grill
A fraction of a second, do you lose or maybe still
Pass it to the left, and collect your mighty kill

Add another bullet, the third round begins
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in
Please, no I.O.U.'s, no markers for death
Does anybody play?

Anybody
Somebody
Everybody

You, you, next victim
You next to die
You, you, next victim
You, your turn to die
You, come on, next victim
You, your turn to die
You, come on, next victim
You, your turn to die
You dieIf you only want to live and die in fear
They tell us to believe just half of what we see
And absolutely nothing that we hear

Resist the twisted truth no matter what the cost
Supplant the rights with wrongs inside our heads
Outlawing all the questions to the answers
That no one likes when someone ends up dead

Dystopia
Dystopia
Dystopia
Dystopia

"What you don’t know" the legend goes "can't hurt you"
If you only want to live and die in a cage
There's panic and there's chaos rampant in the streets
Where useless thoughts of peace are met with rage

Demoralized and overmastered people think
The quickest way to end a war is lose
Dictatorship ends starting with tyrannicide
You must destroy the cancer at its root

Dystopia
Dystopia
Dystopia
DystopiaYou live in a web of deceit
You want it all including me
You like it all to be neat

I come to you when shadows fall
I leave as the dawn arrives
Hide the truth to deceive them all
How my good intention lies

Try to silence the suspicions
Feeding the dark inhibitions
We can never let anyone see
The sin I bring called ecstasy
The sin I bring
Ecstasy

Secret meetings that we hide
Deeds of iniquity
The price of foolish pride
The cost of immorality

And we hide the truth to deceive them all
And the pain of what will never be

Try to silence the suspicions
Feeding the dark inhibitions
We can never let anyone see
The sin I bring called ecstasy
The sin I bring
EcstasyI need to be me, 'cause you're all to clear
And I can see there's something wrong with you
Oh, what do you expect me to do?
At least I gotta know what I wanna be
Don't come to me if you need pity
Are you lonely, you got no-one
You got your body in suspension
That's a problem, problem, problem
The problem is you
Eat your heart out on a plastic tray
You don't do what you want and you fade away
You work for me, you're working nine-to-five
It's too much fun of being alive
I'm using my feet for my human machine
You work for me, living for the screen
Are you lonely, all needs catered
You got your brains dehydrated

Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Oh what what you gonna do, problem, problem
Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Well, what you gonna do with your problem
The problem is you, problem

I ain't death trip, but I ain't automatic
You work for me, just stay ecstatic
Don't you give me any orders
To people like me, there is no order

Bet you thought you had it all worked out
Bet you thought you knew what I was about
Bet you thought you'd solved all your problems
But you are the problem

Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Oh, what you gonna do with your problem?
I'll leave it up to you, oh problem
The problem is you, you got a problem
Oh what you gonna do?
They know a doctor, gonna take you away
Thay take you away and they throw away the key
They don't want you and they don't want me
You got a problem the problem is you
Problem, well, what you gonna do?
Problem, have you got a problem?
Problem, well you got a problem
Problem...I knew Jack Kennedy
Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine
Senator, You're no Jack kennedyThe way you look at me
And it's a hard time
Time you been givin' me

Come on and open up
Open up to me
So you can realize
That I could set you free

Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted days

Well, it's a strange place
That you've been livin' in
And it's a strange line
You've been deliverin'

I think I like it
But I'm not really sure
Don't wanna to fight it
Just wanna feel some more

Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted days

Strange ways, twisted days
Strange ways, twisted daysAfter pulling another gruelling nine to five
I live from credit card to check
The paper money's whirling by
And I hardly just, just barely, only just survive

I'm living on the edge
Reality is teetering
My mind is on the brink

How will I face the day tomorrow if I can't make it through today?
I got nothing left to lose, but my sanity and the right to go insane
I got nothing left to lose, but my mind
I got nothing left to choose, so I think I'll go insane

My stomach aches from insufficient funds
My cheeks are gaunt, my guts are overdrawn
My head pounds, starvation's given me the shakes
Too much squalor, too much pressure, and now I'm getting pissed

I'm living on the edge
Reality is teetering
My mind is on the brink

How will I face the day tomorrow if I can't make it through today?
I got nothing left to lose, but my sanity and the right to go insane
I got nothing left to lose, but my mind
I got nothing left to choose, so I think I'll go insaneA plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough, euphoria's high
More borrowed money, more borrowed time
Backed in a corner, caught up in the race
A means to an end ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

Barren land that once filled the need
Are worthless now, dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip
Nature's scales are forced to tip
The heartland dies, loss of all pride
To leave ain't believing, so try and be tried
Insufficient funds, insanity and suicide

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream



Now with new hope
Some will be proud
This is no hoax, no one pushed out
Receive a reprieve and be a pioneer
Break new ground of a new frontier
New ideas will surely get by
No deed or dividend, some may ask why
You'll find the solution, the answers in the sky

Rise so high, yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough, euphoria's high
More borrowed money, more borrowed time

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

HolocaustIt's four in the morning
I had too much to drink
Said I was out with the boys

I creep in my bedroom
I slip into bed
I know if I wake her, I'll wake up dead

I wonder, will she find out
About the other, other lover
Diana

Wake up dead, you die
Wake up dead, and buried
Wake up dead, you die
Wake up deadHer lips are poisonous venom
Wicked temptress knows how to please
The priestess roars, "Get down on your knees"

The rite of the praying mantis
Kiss the bones of the enchantress
Spellbound searching through the night
A howling man surrenders the fight... the fight

One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf

One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf

My desires of flesh obey me
The lioness will enslave me
Another heartbeat than my own
Sound of claws on cobblestone, I'm stoned

One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf

One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise
Teeth of terror sinking in
The bite of the she-wolf

Beware what stalks you in the night
Beware the she-wolf and her bite
Her mystic lips tell only lies

Beware what stalks you in the night
Beware the she-wolf and her bite
Her hidden will to kill in disguiseHow I could walk away from something so rare 
But you see it all got too demanding, yeah 
And I just didn't care, I just didn't care, if I cared, if I cared 

Lately, I've been left wanting, but not wanting you 
Attraction that once was is no longer there, ooh 
And it sucks to be taken for granted 
When the veil is drawn and there's only air 

I had to walk away 
Give up something I love 
For what I loved even more 
And save my tears for you 

Everything has lost its meaning; I had to let it go 
To find myself, myself, and start something new, brand new 
Forced to look deep in the mirror, face who I really am 
Now it's just me, cause I can't afford you 

I had to walk away 
Give up something I love 
For what I loved even more 
And save my tears for you 

I gave up something I loved 
For what I loved even more 
And I saved my tears for you 
In a vial and walked away 

You were so beautiful to look upon 
I could see the light in your smile 
Your eyes were the windows into your soul 
Your body was heavenly just like the sky 

Until all your good looks betrayed you, which ain't much 
Counted on your counterfeit smiles for too long 
Your eyes are empty windows: broken 
The body may be here, but the soul is gone 

I saved my tears for you in a vial 
From everything wicked thing that you did, that you said 
To send away, buried with your love 
So many tears in a vial, now that you're gone, and now that you're deadAnybody searching for action
Anything to fill the emptiness inside
Any place that the streets are empty
Any takers wanna pour out their lives
With fire and lightning shooting from my hand
And desolation written across my eyes
My itchy fingers on a hairpin trigger
My tempers hot my patience's taken flight

Solo – Drover
Solo –Mustaine

Inside the abattoir
The cover charge is somebody's gotta die
Now, I hear you screaming out for mercy
Last man that's standing wins the fight
Too late, I see your end zero in on you
Even mortal enemies, they can't deny
Let me help you up again
The wings of God surround me
I live to play because I know I'll never die

Solo – Drover
Solo –Mustaine
Solo – Drover
Solo –Mustaine

If I win again, I'm still the champion
And if you win, HA, that's just impossible!
I don't play for keeps; I don't play for your soul
I don't play to win; I don't play for it all
I play for blood.

Solo –Mustaine
Solo – Drover

I don't play for keeps, I play for blood

Solo –Mustaine

I don't play for your soul, I play for blood

Solo – Drover


I don't play to win, I play for blood

Solo –Mustaine

I don't play for it all, I play for blood

Solo – Drover

Play for bloodCrushing our potential and piling it on, how will history portray us?
Attack the family, attack their faith and dreams
Attack the body and the head will fall

A lasting legacy or ruin brought in haste?
The enemy of truth is lying there in state

Another day, another manufactured crisis keeping the people distracted
There's no one playing by the rules anymore, how will history portray us?
A broken backbone with nothing left to lose?
That hate the sight of all the ones that do?

A lasting legacy or ruin brought in haste?
The enemy of truth is lying there in state

A shiny new agenda, birthed from a depraved mind
Of failing us on purpose, to culturally sanitize
Its opiates for the masses under cloak as hope and change
The "new normal" or just more of the same?

The perfect plan
Must have an alibi
And the perfect pawn
To spew the party line
Of the perfect falsehood
Spoke a thousand times
The perfect words
Cover the greatest crime

Hell is turning itself inside out
To lead its path up to meet us
And we deliberately take
A step, one foot closer to the graveSo quiet now she's gone
The dust accumulates into
Mountains on the ground

My paper's piled on the steps
Her flowers all have died
I'm searching everywhere
For someone I'll never find

The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
It's too late, when you've lost your soul
I left her everything, she only left my ring
My world is darker now than the blackest crow

Slide - Dave

Shadows fill this place
She's been away so long
The wallpaper leaves a stain
Where pictures once belonged

You think I would have known
Something was going on
Her kisses were so cold
Her loving touch withdrawn

The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
It's too late, when you've lost your soul
I left her everything, she only left my ring
My world is darker now than the blackest crow

Solo - Dave

They never do teach you how to walk away from someone that you love

The haunting never fades, laughter's gone away
I know it's too late, when you've lost your soul
The fires all but gone, my world is darker now
Than the blackest crow

Slide - Dave

The blackest crow...Where could you be found? 
Were you at the front of the stage? 
Or in the underground 

From SF out to Old Bridge 
New York back to LA 
The world of metal changed forever 
Back in the day 

Well that was back in the day 
And if you weren't there 
It doesn't matter anyway 
Because you wouldn't understand 

Live to die and die to play 
Every day and place 
Leave a path of metal 
Across the world from stage to stage 

Well that was back in the day 
And if you weren't there 
It doesn't matter anyway 
Because you wouldn't understand 

In denim and leather 
We were all part of one force 
Knocked Rock and Roll on its ass 
And put metal on the course 

Higher! 
Higher! 
Higher! 
Higher! 
Back in the day 
You weren't there 
It doesn't matter 
Because you wouldn't understand 

This is our way of life 
A life that was born free 
To follow orders how to live 
Was never meant to be 
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh 

Peals of thunder, sheets of lighting 
The power hits the stage 
The music was exciting 
The mania raged 
On, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh 

We all had the fever 
Our ears started to ring 
Feeding this wildfire 
Consuming everything 
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh 

Metal's King back then 
And still is to this day 
Others imitate or challenge 
But it never goes away 
Oh, oh-oh, oh-ohWashed up, left for dead
I'm lost inside the desert
Of every word you said
Like a nuclear reactor or TNT
I'm thinking about the times when you lied to me
All the innuendo caught up on your hook
I was just a name in your little black book, oh

In your little black book
Oh

I'll get even with you
I'll get even with you, even with you

I'm bitter and I'm twisted
I haven't slept in days
I'm lonely and I'm angry
I can't make it go away
I'm like a bomb that's ticking, I got voices in my head
I got a doll with needles in, wishing you were dead
I'll get you back somehow, that's what I'm gonna do
I'll get you back somehow, your nightmare's coming true

It's coming true

I'll get even with you
I'll... that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna get even with you
I'll get even with you, even with you, even with you

You better look behind you
'Cause there I'm gonna be
I'll be standing in the shadows
With who I used to be

He's slightly schizophrenic
Me and me, and me, and me agree
That you are gonna pay
For what you did to me

I'll get even with you
I'll get even with you

I'll get even with you
I'm gonna get even with you
I'll... that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna
I'm gonna
I'm gonna, gonna

I'll get even with you, even with you (gonna even)
I'll... that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna
I'm gonna, gonna, gonna, gonna

I'll get even with you
I'm gonna get even with you
I'll get even with youSets the stage today
The more insatiable the sex
The more swelled our tongues became

As pre-historic as it seems this is now, today
As pre-historic as it seems this is now

Talkin' 'bout no vision
Talkin' 'bout no dream
The harlot puddles for her lies
From where she speaks

I look above and see entrails in the sky
This one ain't over till the fat lady dies

One man rules the world
And rides the seven-headed beast
Ten diadems to crown them all
The world, religion at his feet

Dreams are told of dreams of old
This day will surely come
So, run my child and hide your face
Once you've been marked, you're finished, done

You'll become one
You're mine
You're one

I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass away
I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass away

Vengeance is mine
Vengeance is mine
The Netherworld and Sheol are never satisfied
So the eyes of man are never satisfied

I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass awayI saw her face
It was the face that I loved
And I knew I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray
That they'd go away
But still they'd begin
Needles and pins

I heard somebody fixed today
There was no last goodbyes to say
His will to live ran out
I heard somebody turned to dust
Looking back at what he left
A list of plans and photographs
Songs that never will be sung
These are the things he won't get done
The things he won't get done

I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)
I've seen them crawl from the cradle (to the gutter on their hands)
They fight a war but it's fatal (it's so hard to understand)
I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)

Just one shot to say goodbye
One last taste to mourn and cry
Cry, cry
Scores and shoots, the lights go dim
Just one shot to do him in
He hangs his head and wonders why
Why the monkey only lies
Lies, lies
But pay the pauper he did choose
He hung his head inside the noose
He hung his head inside the noose

I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)
I've seen them crawl from the cradle (to the gutter on their hands)
They fight a war but it's fatal (it's so hard to understand)
I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)

Cryptic writing
On the wall (the beginning of the end)
I've seen myself use the needle (seen the needle in my hand)

I've seen the man use the needle (seen the needle use the man)
I've seen them crawl from the cradle (to the gutter on their hands)
They fight a war but it's fatal (it's so hard to understand)
I've seen myself use the needle (seen the needle in my hand)
(In my hand)
(In my hand)
In my handAnd you brought your motor to me
You're a burner, yeah, a real motor car

Said you want to get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, ya know, luckily for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me, I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat

We were shifting hard when we took off
Put tonight all four on the floor
When we hit top end, you know it feels so slow

Said you want to get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, ya know, luckily for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me, I do it for my life
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat

I'm giving you my room service
And you know it's more than enough
Oh, one more time, you know I'm in love

Said you want to get your order filled
Made me shiver when I put it in
Pumping just won't do, ya know, luckily for you

Whoever thought you'd be better
At turning a screw than me, I do it for my life, fuck yeah
Made my drive shaft crank, made my pistons bulge
Made my ball bearings melt from the heat, oh yeahA mighty wreck that once was proud
Ate alive by oxidation
Abandoned by a crew of cowards
Navigation systems failed
Computers crashed and they all fall down

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18 I know too much

All the guilty paid the price
Suspended by their broken necks
No one survived to tell the story
When foreign life forms resurrect
And military intelligence is
Still two words that can't make sense

Possibly I've seen too much
Hangar 18 I know too muchI'm a social disease 
I've come for your wealth 
Leave you on your knees 
No time for feeling sorry 
I got here on my own 
I won't ask for mercy 
I choose to walk alone 

Oh what's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine too 
If you shake my hand, better count your fingers

What if I do get caught? 
What if there is no judgment? 
If I'm right, I lose nothing 
If you're right, I lose it all

And I oughta get caught 
Because I'm doing something wicked 
I'm guilty, haunted by my fears 
And the only consequences 
Are dread and the fugitive mind 

You built walls to protect you 
So no one will infect you 
Pursued by those out there 
That vanish in thin air 
Come a long way to find 
What you really left behind 
You don't know when the end is 
But it's coming fast

Oh what's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine too
If you shake my hand, better count your fingers

What if I do get caught?
What if there is no judgment?
If I'm right, I lose nothing
If you're right, I lose it all

I oughta get caught
Because I'm doing something wicked 
I'm guilty, haunted by my fears 
And the only consequences 
Are dread and the fugitive mindThey said it'd never come, we knew it was a lie
All forms of life die now, the humans all succumb
Time to kiss your ass goodbye, the end has just begun

Distorted figures walk the street, it's 1999
Weeds once underneath your feet have grown to vines
Bodies melted like a candle, a land without a face
No time to change your fate, no time left, it's too late

The arsenal of Megadeth can't be rid, they said
And if it comes, the living will envy the dead
Racing for power and all come in last
No winning, first stone cast
This falsehood, worldly peace
It's treaties soon will cease
No one will be left to prove that humans existed
Maybe soon the children will be born open-fisted
We all live on one planet, it will all go up in smoke

Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy
And now the final scene, a global darkening

Dig deep the piles of rubble and ruins
Towering overhead, both far and wide
There's unknown tools for World War III
Einstein said, "We'll use rocks on the other side"

No survivors, set the world afireTalk to him every day
What do you mean I don't support your system?
I go to court when I have to
And what do you mean I can't get to work on time?
Got nothing better to do
What do you mean I don't pay my bills?
Why do you think I'm broke? Huh?

If there's a new way
Well, I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time

What do you mean I hurt your feelings?
I didn't know you had any feelings
What do you mean I ain't kind?
I'm just not your kind
What do you mean, I couldn't be the President
Of the United States of America?
Tell me something, it's still "we the people", right?

If there's a new way
I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time

Woah woah

Can you put a price on peace?

Peace
Peace sells
Peace
Peace sells

Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?

Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?

Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?

No, no no no no
Peace sells (Oh)
Peace sells, ahI saw you, across the room
I knew I had to have you

Thus started the chase
I knew I would do anything
To take your hand and make you mine

But I learned long ago
If you love someone, you have to let it go
The hardest part of letting go
Is saying goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye

(Sealed with a kiss)

Fettered away in a makeshift cell
Beneath the venomous moonlight
I unleash my plan to watch you fail
The one I held so high

Go to sleep, my love
Taste my sweet revenge on your lips
It's sealed with a kiss

I return to the masquerade ball
And leave the lone figure weeping
Stone by stone, immured in the wall
Forever left in safekeeping

Go to sleep, my love
Taste my sweet revenge on your lips
It's sealed with a kiss

(The hardest part of letting go... (continued))

But I learned long ago
If you love someone, you have to let it go
Let it go, let it go
The hardest part of letting go
Is saying goodbye
Goodbye, goodbyeMy faults were letters carved in stone
As meaningful to you as words written in water
I'm left to walk this world alone

Fill solos - Mustaine

In a broken mold they made me
The black sheep of the family
Worth less than zero my opinion
And room temperature IQ

I did something, now I'm nothing
Always wrong with this or that
Poisoned with fear watch it twist
My measly brain mad

Solo - Pitrelli

Talk about me when my back is turned
Next time we meet it will be to late
The memory burned in my ears of what you said
And now I've got a recipe for hate. Taste it

Fill solos - Mustaine

Dark clouds on the horizon
Make it hard to breathe
A walking mistake but every time
I run away, I just come back for more

The choice is clear I can quit
And fall on my sword or light a fire
To see who runs or stays
And plays the confidence game

Solo - PitrelliAnd you see that you're all alone
When your friends they have all run out
That is when you will know I'm the one

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
'til the world explodes ('til the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (like a super collider)

This could be all the heaven you'll see
Life can be wicked, mean and cold
Could this be the end of your living hell
Come with me and I'll free your soul (hooah)

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
'til the world explodes ('til the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (like a super collider)

Just one thing that I want you to know
You don't need to be on your own
No more feeling left out in the cold
Take my hand and I'll take you home

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
'til the world explodes ('til the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (like a super collider)

On the high road (on the high road)
I will take you higher (I will take you higher)
'til the world explodes ('til the world explodes)
Just like a super collider (super collider yeah)

On the high road (like a super collider)
I will take you higher (like a super collider)
'til the world explodes (like a super collider)
Super collider!An insane place, with insane moves
Battles without, for battles within
Where evil lives and evil rules
Breaking them up, just breaking them in
Quickest way out, quickest relief wins
Never disclose, never betray
Cease to speak or cease to breathe
And when you kill a man, you're a murderer
Kill many, and you're a conqueror
Kill them all... ooh... oh, you're a god!



Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

No time for questions
No time for games
Start kicking ass
And taking down the names
A long shit list
A shorter fuse
He is untouchable
And guarantees you'll lose

Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

Inside the big house
His nightmare unfolds
Before he got there
His man-pussy was sold
Black blanket welcome
This tough guy's now a bitch
Praying for death
It can't be worse than this

Captive honour, ain't no honour
Captive honour, ain't no honour

Captive honour, ain't no honourAll feelings have died, anyone would know it
They say those sticks and stones
They say they crush my bones
I say I don't get mad; I get even, before they do

Spoils goto the victor and dead on time
your time is going to come

One day I'll dance on you grave
Even if you're buried at sea
Till then, till when I exact my revenge
I'll tell them, "You're dead to me"

We're all just trying to hold on to innocence
You think they'd notice what we're trying to do
These wounds are invisible
Underneath the dirt I still see the scars
Back then when things got bad
And we spread our wings and fly away

You'll take all your riches in the back of a hearse
Your time is going to come

One day I'll dance on your grave
Even if you're buried at sea
Till then, till when I exact my revenge
I'll tell them, "You're dead to me"

One day I'll dance on your grave
Even if you're buried at sea
Till then, till when I exact my revenge

One day I'll dance on your grave
Even if you're buried at sea
Till then, till when I exact my revenge
I'll tell them, "You're dead to me"I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became

I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans denied

So as you read this, know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Smile when you think of me
My body's gone, that's all





These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

If my heart was still alive
I know it would surely break
And my memories left with you
There's nothing more to say

Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living, all are scarred





These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

So as you read, know, my friends
I'd love to stay with you all
Please, smile, smile when you think about me
My body's gone, that's all





These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free





These are the last words
I'll ever speak
And they'll set me freeDance of the macabre, as witches streak the sky
Decadent worship of black magic sorcery
In the womb of the Devil's Dungeon, trapped without a plea, oh

Seething in agony, necrosis is the fate
Pins sticking through the skin, the venom now sedates
Locked in a pillory, nowhere to be found
Screaming for your life, but no one hears a sound, help me!

Prepare the patient's scalp to peel away
Metal caps his ears he'll hear not what we say
Solid steel visor riveted across his eyes
Iron staples close his jaws so no one hears his cries

The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath the skin

Now you're drawn and quartered your bones will make the X
Symbol stands for poison and it's chained to your head
And as we fold your arms to make the holy cross
We cross the crucifix religion has been lost

The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath the skin

The skull beneath the skinIn the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy, hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost, the spoils of wars are yours to keep
Aw!

Great nations built from the bones of the dead with mud and straw
Blood and sweat, you know your worth
When your enemies praise your architecture of aggression
Praise your architecture of aggression

Hoo! Ensuing power vacuum
A toppled leader dies
His body fuels the power
Fire and the flames rise to the sky
One side of his face, a kiss, the other genocide
Time to pay
With your ass, a worldwide suicide

Great nations built from the bones of the dead with mud and straw
Blood and sweat, you know your worth
When your enemies praise your architecture of aggression

Born from the dark
In the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below
Deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy
Hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost, the spoils of war are yours to keep

Great nations built from the bones of the dead with mud and straw
Blood and sweat, you know your worth
When your enemies praise your architecture of aggression

Great nations built from the bones of the dead with mud and straw
Blood and sweat, you know your worth
When your enemies praise your architecture of aggressionCrush, crush, crush, crush 'em
Crush, crush, crush, crush 'em
Crush, crush, crush, crush 'em
Crush, crush, crush, crush 'emSomehow you got betrayed agin
Thin ice and luck runs out
Who will you blame it on this time?

Due to lack of interest in you
The light at the end of the tunnel
Was turned off
And something I noticed
Beating you is thrilling me
I've got a secret for you

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

Don't close your eyes to injustice
Listen, being brave ain't chicken shit
A man without any valor
Has nothing worth living for

Due to lack of interest in you
The light at the end of the tunnel
Was turned off
And something I noticed
Beating you is thrilling me
I've got a secret for you

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the timeSegregating ourselves by class and size
It's me against you in everything that they do
This planet's become one big spinning disaster

If you don't like where we're going
Then you won't like what's coming next

What will we look like?
In a post American world
Why cower to all those
Who oppose the American world?

When you walk away from that which makes you strong
You only fool yourself; you only weaken your cause
There's creeping hate if you resist the false narrative
Crushing all the dissenters who still think for them selves

If you don't like where we're going
Then you won't like what's coming next

What will we look like?
In a post American world
Why cower to all those
Who oppose the American world?No one cares anymore
The messiah or mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door

A culture made of cover-ups
Will leprosy touch their flesh?
For backroom meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest

The clock runs out, the weakest link
A deadly strike, the threat is real

See the burnished images
Of a crest fallen agency
Violent conditioning
Caused the nature of the enemy

Your terminal lack of vision
Blinded eyes see no light
A chronic lack of perspective
Their cancer now eats us alive

A fatal shot, a lust for blood
The final act, the threat is real

Justified obliteration
No one cares anymore
The messiah or a mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door

A culture made of cover-ups
Will leprosy touch their flesh?
For backroom meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest

The clock runs out, the weakest link
A deadly strike, the threat is real
The final act, a lust for blood
A fatal shot, the threat is realHa! No, you're not there
And though I reached out for you
Wouldn't lend a hand
Through the darkest hour
Grace didn't shine on me
It feels so cold
Very cold, no one cares for me

Did you ever think I get lonely?
Did you ever think that I needed love ?
Did you ever think to stop thinking?
You're the only one that I'm thinking of

You'll never know
How hard I tried
To find my space and satisfy you too

Things will be better
When I'm dead and gone
Don't try to understand
Knowing you

I'm probably wrong
But, oh
How I lived my life for you
Still you'd turn away
Now
As I die for you
My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name
All these years
I thought I was wrong
Now I know it was you
Raise your head
Raise your face
Your eyes, tell me who you think you are?

I walk
I walk alone
Into the promised land
There's a better place for me
But it's far, far away

Everlasting life for me
In a perfect world
But I gotta die first
Please god send me on my way

Time has a way of taking time
Loneliness is not only felt by fools
Alone I call to ease the pain
Yearning to be held by you, alone
So alone, I'm lost consumed by the pain

The pain
The pain
The pain
Won't you hold me again?
And you just laughed, ha-ha! Bitch!
My whole life is work built on the past
But the time has come when all
Things shall pass
This good thing passed awayAs I hold you
Now gone, I miss you
But I told you
I remember bad times
More than good
There's no coming back
Even if we could

I loved you to death
I loved you to death

If I can't have you
Then no one will
And since I won't
I'll have to kill
My only love, something
I've never felt
Now you've gone to heaven
And I'll burn in hell

I loved you to death 
I loved you to death
I loved you to death
I loved you to death
Aww!

And now I'm down below
And what do I see
You didn't go to heaven
Your down here with me
And now coming back,
Baby, take me, please!
I really think I would
If you weren't such a sleaze
I loved you once before
You kept me on a string
I'd rather go without
Than take what you would bring

I loved you to death
Aww!Something you call love ()
You've been ()
And now someone else ()

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces

No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks

Well, we got no class
And we got no principles
And we got no innocence
We can't even think of a word that rhymes

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces

No more pencils
No more books
No more teacher's dirty looks
Out for summer
Until fall
We might not go back at all

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's out with fever
School's out completelyThe devil's henchmen, in suit and tie
A sacred brotherhood; an ancient rite
Politicians and the double lives they hide

Violate your rights, no more equality
Surrender freedom, your Social Security
We, the people face unconstitutional lies
In greed we trust, in revolution we die

Our founding fathers are rolling in their graves
The land of liberty needs a regime change
Until you no longer know right from wrong
The constitution isn't worth the paper it's written on

Violate your rights, no more equality
Surrender freedom, your Social Security
We, the people face unconstitutional lies
In greed we trust, in revolution we die

Screams from the future, warn of calamity
The coming plagues of the new disease
The illuminati, one world currency
One world religion, one World everything

Violate your rights, no more equality
Surrender freedom, your Social Security
We, the people face unconstitutional lies
In greed we trust, in revolution we die

We, the people face unconstitutional lies
In greed we trust, in revolution we dieListen, I didn't start this - believe me, I will finish it...
You called down the thunder - too late now there's no way out...
Nothing is gonna stop me - until then better watch your back...

Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!

There is no retreating - I will cut you down to size...
You will beg for mercy - a bad seed, you're as good as dead...
Yield to new dimension - Hell's coming, better say your prayers...

Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?
What do you think your fists are for?

Solo - Chris

One day you will face me - and see the terror trapped inside...
Final retribution - torture and pure punishment...
Vengeance running so deep - a dungeon of agony awaits...
Fear not as death surrounds you - Bitch all you want, but here it comes...

Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?
What do you think your fists are for?

Solo - ChrisAnd the newest slavery is to keep the people poor
And stupid; "Novus Ordo Seclorum"
How can there be any logic in biological war?
We all know this is wrong, but the New World Order's beating down the door
Oh, something needs to be done

There was a king (an evil king)
Who dreamt the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery, no prophet could interpret
Of seven years of famine
The wolf is at my door, as predicted years ago
That that was, that is, that is no more
The word predicts the future
And tells the truth about the past
Of how the world leaders will hail the new Pharaoh
The eighth false king to the throne; Washington is next!

Disengage their minds, sabotage their health
Promote sex and war, and violence in the kindergartens
Blame the parents and teachers, it's their fault; "Annuit Cœptis"
Attack the church dynamic
Attack the family, keep the public undisciplined till nothing left is sacred
And the "have-nots" get hooked and have to go to the "haves"
Just to cop a fix

I am the king (an evil king)
Who dreams the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery, nobody could interpret
Of seven empires falling
The wolf is at my door, as predicted years ago
That that was, that is, that is no more
The word predicts my future
And tells the truth about my past
Of how the world leaders are waiting to usher in
The eighth world power of modern Rome; Washington is next!

There was a king (an evil king)
Who dreamt the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery, no prophet could interpret
Of seven empires fallen
The wolf is at my door, as predicted years ago
That that was, that is, that is no more
I am a king
And I dream the wildest dreams
And nobody could interpret
Seven empires falling
The wolf is at my door
Ooh, that that was, that is, that is no more

There's something at my door
Some anciet mystery
The future tells the truth about the past
And I'm the eighth false king to the throne
I've got you in my crosshairs
Now, ain't that a bitch?
Washington...
You're next!Complete life in disarray
A simple man, power drunk
No worries of living, no more anything

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Actions progress to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the reasons that we sin?

Not one to be forgot
Spoiled rotten, so they say
Once burned, forever marked
Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Actions progress to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the reasons that we sin?

Pressure
Coming down
Down on me
Gonna break
Broken
Fingernails
Digging in
Scratch my face

Nervous
Like a cat
Gonna jump
Through my skin
Shadows
On the wall
Stretching out
Grope for me

(Reasons) Deep in me
(Reasons) Let me be
(Reasons) Let me bleed
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) Set me free
(Reasons) The reasons that we sinWhen I said I need you
You stretched the truth
When you said that you knew
Just can't believe it
There's nothing to say
I was almost honest
Almost

Living alone
Can't stand this place
It's four in the morning
And I still see your face

I was nearly pure
When I said I loved you
You were semi-sincere
You said I'd bleed for you
We were kind of candid
Now you've gone away
You were almost honest
Almost

Living alone
Falling from grace
I want to atone
But there's just empty space
I can't face tomorrow (I can't face tomorrow)
Now you're not coming back (you're not coming back)
Walked off in the night (walked off in the night)
And just left me the tracks (and just left me the tracks)

I question the call
By the tone of your voice
I know I should hang up
But I don't have a choice

It happened that night
When you told me to go
Don't ask who's to blame
I don't know

Living alone (living alone)
Falling from grace (falling from grace)
I want to atone (I want to atone)
But there's just empty space (but there's just empty space)
I can't face tomorrow (I can't face tomorrow)
Now you're not coming back (now you're not coming back)
Walked off in the night (walked off in the night)

(Almost) Almost honest
(Almost) I was almost honest
(Almost) I was almost honest

(Almost) Almost, almost honest
(Almost) Almost honest
(Almost) Almost honestIn any shadow
Any place where danger waits to kill my time
There is one who lies and waits
To seal your fate
As sure as you live and die

Live and die
Live and die

When you feel there's something wrong
I shelter you and keep you warm
I never let you walk alone
I loved you when you still hated me
I'm coming and I won't be long
Time to reap what I have sown
Never ever let you walk alone
I know your enemy once was me

(solo - Glen)

Let me wrap my arms all around you
Suffer the trespasses that you made
I will drink your pain away
Forever and a day
If you just call out my name

If you just call
Out my name

If you just call
Even whisper it

When you feel there's something wrong
I shelter you and keep you warm
I never let you walk alone
I loved you when you still hated me
I'm coming and I won't be long
It's time to reap what I have sown
Never ever let you walk alone
I know your enemy once was me

OhhhYou're drifting and ya don't believe in anyone 
To lose what little you have left to be proud of 
Afraid you can't do this again, ah! 

You said that nothing come in-between us 
The way of getting things we wanted done 
Then enissophobia held you under its influence 
Until you compromised your style 

Everything about you has been one big charade 
What will you do now that the well's run dry? Cry? 
To sell out all your friends and stab them in the back 
It's something that you are; it's something that I'm not 

When you forced me into doing what you love 
Mark my words no one loves you very much, yeah mark em' 
And when you tried to change me and tried to replace me 
I couldn't help but end just hating you, hmm! 

Being a fraud can only last so long, you should know 
Till what ya sensed as a child returns, you little baby 
To choke out the voice that told ya "money and the fame"
Would fill the crater that you dug for yourself 

Unlike you I'm no vision to myself, lest you forget 
You didn't ever make metal, buddy; metal made you 
To crush and run over everyone along the way 
It's something that you are; it's something that I'm not 

A stranger to yourself, ha! ya pissed me off again 
I won't be driven by your needs anymore 
What you'd become to do or be is clear to see for me 
It's something that you are; something that I'm not 

It makes me sick to hear you say you "love me"
I know you only love what I can do for you 
If you were the one that was leading the charge 
Would you notice if I missed a day or two? But that's impossible! 

We all laughed at the parodies that you'd become 
Now your pain slowly paid back has begun 
So, accept my resignation, or in your words "betrayal"
Before it gets much worse, end this self-sabotage 

Something that I'm not, something that you are, something I'm not 

Something that I'm not, something that you are, something I'm not 
Something that you are, something I'm not, yetTo dominate and kill
A glistening murder machine
False majesty standing perfectly still
A blitzkrieg raining down evil
On a mountain of black ice
Like a good old fashioned beating within
Inches of your life

While alone and left abandoned
With the sentence you've been handed
All your angels will ignore you
As your life flashes before you
Even still you keep on fighting
Through the thunder and the lightning
And now Heaven sends its love
Your sudden death from above

Once frozen like a prisoner depraved
Perched high atop the lithosphere
Set free from beneath the depths of hell
Bequeathing anything but despair
The beast is genetically programmed
Time to destroy, time to go berserk
To see the end of all wars
To see the end of the Earth

Stopping at nothing, punch drunk
From the blood that he's tasted
Tearing your soul apart
Not one bit of your pain will be wasted
Now death descends upon you
Like a bloody white dove
Bringing your retribution
Your sudden death from above

While alone and left abandoned
With the sentence you've been handed
All your angels will ignore you
As your life flashes before you
Even still you keep on fighting
Through the thunder and the lightning
And now Heaven sends its love
Your sudden death from aboveAnd blindfolded her so she can't see
The erosion of the people's trust
Of what will come to be an FDIC assisted suicide

The depression of a depression
Worldwide suicide for the economy
Caused by the dialectic chaos when the mob on Wall Street
Took "We the people" for a ride

When it's dog eat dog, you are what you eat
Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
Like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds

They took everything and anything
As long as it once belonged to me
The rats got all the money
The roaches licked the cupboards clean of TV dinners and beer

This never-ending nightmare
Of the dreams I'll never, ever get to see
And just one silver bullet to your head
It will set me free from all the life I wasted trusting you

When it's dog eat dog, you are what you eat
Just like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
Like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
When it's dog eat dog, you are what you eat
Like the mad dog that bites the hand that feeds
Just like the mad dog you bite the hand that feedsLeading me unfulfilled
Promising compromise
Championing mediocrity

Time and time again
What you said ain't what you mean
Even if all my bones are broken
I will drag myself back from the edge to

Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
I am the king, God save the king

Kill the king, the king is dead, I am the king, long live the king
Kill the king, the king is dead, I am the king, long live the king

I reveal a deceiver
In the highest seat in the land
His idle hands the devil's workshop
Generate more smoke than heat

Time and time again
What you said ain't what you mean
Even if all my bones are broken
I will drag myself back from the edge to

Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
I am the king, God save the king

A new precedent in pain, a new precedent in pain
Mankind is blown to dust, mankind is blown to dust
An explosion of the brain, an explosion of the brain
Spontaneously combust, spontaneously combust

Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
I am the king

Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
I am the king

Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
I am the king

Kill the king, the king is dead, long live the king
I am the kingAnd we pay for the machine you're feeding
You can never shut up, you can never shut down
This house divided

We all know, we all know, something's wrong, we all know

Something's wrong about the way you're thinking
The rats are jumping, and your ship is sinking
You can never get on, you can never get off
This house divided...

We all hear about the case you're pleading
Your demands have gone beyond conceding
You can never get in, you can never get out
This house divided...

This is a sad day for violence
When speech results in silence
I'm supposed to hate you
You're supposed to hate me
We can never agree

Solo - Chris

Now we've become so desperate
Don't you forget you asked for it!
I'm supposed to hate you
You're supposed to hate me
We never agree

Solo - Chris

Solo - Dave

We all know about the hate you're breeding
And we pay for the machine you're feeding
A house divided...Nothing's what it seems
Searching my head
For the words that you said

Tears filled my eyes (eyes)
As we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays
Of you walking away

Me duele todo el cuerpo por los errores
Traisionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que en nada confiamos

Time and again
She repeats, "Let's be friends"
I smile and say yes
Another truth bent
I must confess

I try to let go, but I know
We'll never end till we're dust
We lied to each other again (but I wish I could trust)
But I wish I could trust

Me duele todo el cuerpo por los errores
Traisionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que en nada confiamos

Dios te lo pido de rodillas
Ayudame por favor
Traisionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que en nada confiamos

Como pudo sucederme esto a mi
Miento cuando digo confia en mi
No puedo creer que esto sea verdad
La confianza duele
Porque la confianza es igual a sufrimiento (sufrimiento)

Me duele todo el cuerpo por los errores
Traisionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que en nada confiamos

Dios te lo pido de rodillas
Ayudame por favor
Traisionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno al otro
Que en nada confiamos

Me duele todo el cuerpo por los errores
Traisionados por la lujuria
Nos mentimos tanto el uno...

No confiamos absolutamente en nadaUnder the stars and the moon
Sounds of galloping horses
On clouds of lightning and thunder

A dark gathering storm
To scorch the earth for many generations
A nuclear winter
Worse than any cold or holy war

A white horse on the clouds of death
A red warhorse to end all wars
A pale horse and pestilence led by a
Black horse with famine and scales

The doctrine of hatred
Nation will rise against nation
Wash me in blood and let me be
The firstborn of the dead

A crowned rider with arrows and bow
A red rider with a great firey sword
Flames come from the one called death
Horror and apocalypse follows

(RIDE!) Won't you four horsemen ride again
Before this kingdom is blown to kingdom come

I hold fast to what I believe
Till I see my name in stone

Blessed are the dead

A white horse on the clouds of death
A red warhorse to end all wars
A pale horse and pestilence led by a
Black horse with famine and scales

The synagogue of satan
Nation will rise against nation
Wash me in blood and let me be
The firstborn of the dead

A crowned rider with arrows and bow
A red rider with a great firey sword
Flames come from the one called death
Horror and apocalypse follows

(RIDE!) Won't you four horsemen ride again
Before this kingdom is blown to kingdom come
I hold fast to what I believe
Till I see my name in stone

Blessed are the deadAnd nothing costs as much as playing the game
She had to know, know, know... he'd give love for sex
He had to know, know, know... she'd give sex for love

The taste, touching his tongue, sweet to his lips
Poison, now penetrating deeper
Betrayed by just one bite, for just one night
To find forbidden fruit tastes sweeter

Just like pressing a loaded gun to your head
One knows only the spider can navigate its web
She had to know, know, know... he'd get what he wants
He had to know, know, know... she'd get what she needs

Soon under the spell, emotions are high
Mind control penetrating deeper
The hex was cast on him, all he believes
Now is forbidden fruit tastes sweeter

She had to know, know, know... he'd win at the start
He had to know, know, know... she'd win in the end

His one last thought blew his mind, bullet to the brain
Hot lead was penetrating deeper
Just one reckless shot squeezed from the hand
That knows forbidden fruit tastes sweeterShot in cold blood, no chance to fight
The stage is set, now pay the price
An ego boost, don't think twice
Technology, the battle's unfair
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you man
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned...
The hunt is canned

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction

Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare
The skin and trophy, oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt, and take your turn
Liars anagram is "lairs"
Man, you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank, you're so courageous...
So courageous

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction

One hour from now
Another species of life form
Will disappear off the face of the planet
Forever...and the rate is accelerating

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinctionWhen Cain struck down Abel, a family broken 
Since then mankind's dominated his own kind 
To insult and injure, there's no such thing as peace 
Till death do us part, till the last 

Truth be told - Sin lies at the doorway 
Truth be told - Hell's open for business now 
Truth be told - The soil cries out for revenge 
Truth be told - And death is upon the ground 
All around 

The battle ain't over without spoils of war 
Just cause it is written does not make it so 
When you dance with the devil wait till the song's over 
I ask myself, how bad do I want you to live?' 
My anger is near, till the last 

Truth be told - Sin lies at the doorway 
Truth be told - Hell's open for business now 
Truth be told - The soil cries out for revenge 
Truth be told - And death is upon the ground 
All around 

Tribulation strikes and we're hit hard 
Still you just go on your way 
Head in the sand, ignoring the rain 
Just like the flood in Noah's day 
In his day 

Can't punish those ruining the earth 
It's suicide to some degree 
Because we are all guilty, guilty as sin 
There will be no peace, never for you and for me 

Before al Qaeda and Bin Laden 
Long before Hitler and Hussein 
Ever since the first murder was committed 
The verdict's always been the same 

The cursed future just repeats the past 
There's hell to pay and stones to cast 
So, there will be no peace, never be peace 
Till the last truth be told by you and meStand up, plant your feet
Listen, I'm letting off steam
Now throw your hands in the air
Let it loose, I don't fucking care

Rattlehead

A dose of metal you need
To bang your head till you bleed
It's time for snapping some neck
Slashing, thrashing to Megadeth

Rattlehead

You, your head is pounding with pain
You shake loose parts of your brain
Winning, sinning, beginning
Feeding, the needing for bleeding
Bashing, smashing, crashing
Frying, annihilating you!

There's someone back in the shadows
You can't see his eyes
He'll bash your head if you cross him
Ain't quite your average guy
Don't wear no leather to "fit in"
Don't wear no spikes to be "cool"
Don't want no woman beside him
Just make it fast, loud and rude

Rattlehead

I'm a rattlehead
Rattle your goddamn head!Get it right, terminate them
The Panzers will, permeate them
Break their pride, denigrate them
And their people, retrograde them
Typhus, deteriate them
Epidemic, devastate them
Take no prisoners, cremate them

Going to war, give 'em hell
D-Day, next stop Normandie
Beginning of the end
WE know how to and sure as shit we'll win
War is peace sure man
A retreat for the damned
A playground for the demented
A haven for those who walk this world
Bereft of heart and soul
Love and war they say all is fair
Take his life
But won't take his hair
Your body has parts your
Country can spare
By the way son here's
Your wheelchair

He once had to be all he could be
Now he's nothing for no one nowhere to see
Funny thing, he's like you & me
It's a funny thing, a funny thing
Tears streak his solemn stare
Abandoned for wreckage nobody cares
No one knew what would happen there
No one spoke no one even dared
Don't ask what you can do for you country
Ask what your country can do for you
Take no prisoners, take no shitNo one will ever miss a menace to society
A gross lack of potential, bad decisions made in spite
A touchy hairpin trigger and such a wasted life

Trying to break the mold of a broken family
Fighting damn sure failure, and living on his knees
Guilty of the crime of nonconformity
A hanging judge and jury handing down the penalty

A lethal injection, now they watch the body jerk
Exterminate the problem, except it didn’t work

No vital sign of life, they declared it wasn’t there
Coroner never checked, because he didn’t fucking care
Passing off the body, they all believe he died
Starting up the hearse, set out for a final drive

Like whistling past a graveyard, when walking by at night
It’s a fatal illusion to think that evil ever dies

In a darkened mortuary, reeking of formaldehyde
Aroused from deadly slumber, something opened up his eyes

Spilling all their blood was a promise that he’d keep
Hate so strong revived him from a deep necrotic sleep

Clawing away the casket lid until his fingers bleed
He grabbed a knife and set out on a vivisection spree

A butcher, hell bent, massacring each one with his blade
From the first one to the last, he dispatched them to the grave

It’s a fatal illusion…

Evil never dies
It never diesPersecuting their 'own kind', there's nothing you can say
Don't ask anyone for help, they won't know what to do
If you try, if you don't die, you'll end up black and blue

Epidemic of addiction, worshipping the pill
Drown them all with alcohol, anything for thrills
Precious life goes up in smoke, going nowhere fast
The world is running rampant and you know that this can't last

I want everything that makes me feel alright
That feels alive, don't ask me why
I want everything, right before my eyes
I can't deny I want to be the King!
Kingmaker!

Searching for an answer, but you see you're all alone
Mom and Daddy's lights are on but nobody's home
They glorify their tortured life; they talk of days like this
Sentencing their children, when they need to eat a fist

Narcotics have enslaved them; now it's coming after you
Pearl of wisdom hit the floor, there's nothing you can do
Out of control, you sell your soul, so blind, you couldn't see
Ten feet tall, it made you crawl; it's better you than me

I want everything that makes me feel alright
That feels alive, don't ask me why
I want everything, right before my eyes
I can't deny I want to be the King!
Kingmaker!

I want everything that makes me feel alright
That feels alive, don't ask me why
I want everything, right before my eyes
I can't deny I want to be the King!
It makes me feel alive, I want everything
It makes me feel alright, I want everything
The things I can't deny, I want everything
I want to be the King!Ain't got no smoke
Ain't got a car
His life's a joke

Living on the skids
Thinks the world's just fine
Forgot what he did
Dancing on the breadline

No one there to bind him
Nothing to remind him
Nowhere left to find him

About to lose his lifeline
He's dancing on the breadline

Forgot who he is
Forgot who he was
Used to call the shots
Now he can't connect the dots

A mover and shaker
Getting closer to his maker
Lower than a hemline
Dancing on the breadline

No one there to bind him
Nothing to remind him
Nowhere left to find him

About to lose his lifeline
He's looking for a headline
Sniffing up the white lines
He's dancing on the breadline

Watch him dance

About to lose his lifeline
He's looking for a headline
Sniffing up the white lines
He's dancing on the breadline
About to lose his lifeline
He's dancing on the breadline

No one, nothing, nowhere
Dancing on the breadline

He forgot and he ain't got nothingShe was shooting pool with friends
I sent someone over and
I watched her shake her head, she said

If I wanted to meet her
I had to come at least that far
Introduced myself to a look that would kill
She sneered, "I know who you are"
Oh yeah, that's right, climb on and hold tight
She is all I want in a girl

Solo - Dave

We took off on a rocket ride
It felt like it would never end
I started moving in on over
And I watched her tilt her head, she said

If I'm gonna lay it on her, it'd better
Be more than just tonight
At that moment I knew after I kissed you
I've known you all my life, she said

Oh yeah, that's right, climb on and hold tight
She is all I want in a girl
Oh yeah, that's right, I like that she's all spice
I am all she wants in my girl

Solo - Chris

All I want, all I need, all I want, all that I need...

All I want in a girl, she is all that... I want

All I want, all I need, all I want, all that I need...

She is all that I wantYou just won't need them anymore
And your mind is ours to do with what we please
Everything you own and everything you need

Sacrifice you leaders; like it or not
Or else you're going down with the ship; death on the rocks

Blind follow; blind lead
All our hopes and dreams, washed out to sea

All your money's ours to bankroll corrupt wars
You can't see what you're fighting for
Trust your leaders as they send you out to die
The true face of evil can't be seen without eyes

Sacrifice you leaders; like it or not
Or else you're going down with the ship; death on the rocks

Blind follow; blind lead
All our hopes and dreams, washed out to sea

At the start of time; many centuries ago
Came the spawning of Christ and the Antichrist
And darkness fell upon our people
And the children, they were born faceless
Without eyes they could not see
Born unto themselves; they lived and they died
In the Millennium of the Blind

Blind follow; blind lead
All our hopes and dreams, washed out to seaIn a mire of hypocrisy, ignores sex crimes by its blue helmets, and enables terrorism, so in the end, it has failed. And the UN is where our so-called friends get to stab us in the back, and we pay 22% of their tab to host our enemies here at home.

Ambassadors from countries otherwise known as "The Catastrophe" enjoy Diplomatic immunity, living in Manhattan, while their children are turned into prostitutes. It's a complete and utter disgrace! A blot on the face of humanity! And they get away with it!?!

Poverty in their kitchens
Held hostage by oil-for-food
Yet their own plates are full off the fat of their lands
There's no blood on their hands, right Gojo?
They promised to tell the truth
Without leaving a fingerprint.
They will lose the UN one way or another.
The victim, I fear will be us, sisters and brothers!

The UN is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now, the UN is undone.
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun.
The threat is real, the Locust King has come.
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done.
It's payback time, at the United Abominations.

A grave and gathering danger
The decision to attack
Based on secret intelligence, it'll take years
I fear to undo the failings in Iraq.
You may bury the bodies
But you can't bury the crimes.
Only fools stand up and really lay down their arms
No, not me, not when Death lasts forever

The UN is right; you can't be any more "un"
Than you are right now, the UN is undone.
Another mushroom cloud, another smoking gun.
The threat is real, the Locust King has come.
Don't tell me the truth; I don't like what they've done.
It's payback time.

NATO invaded Yugoslavia to end ethnic cleansing, there was no UN.
The US invaded Afghanistan after 9/11, there was no UN.
Saddam Hussein violated 17 UN resolutions; The UN was asked to join the war in Iraq. The US invaded, there was no UN.
Libya bombed a discotheque in Berlin killing Americans, there was no UN.
Iran funds a mosque, and attacked the US in the seventies, there was no UN.
Facing war, without end, looking into the future.
There...was...no...more...UN!

Psychotron!Nothing's what it seems
Searching my head
For the words that you said

Tears filled my eyes (eyes)
As we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays
Of you walking away

My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust

Time and again
She repeats let's be friends
I smile and say yes
Another truth bent
I must confess

I try to let go, but I know
We'll never end 'till we're dust
We lied to each other again (but I wish I could trust)
But I wish I could trust

My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust (in nothing we trust)

God help me please, on my knees (on my knees)
Betrayed by lust (by lust)
We lied to each other so much (so much)
Now there's nothing we trust

How could this be happening to me?
I'm lying when I say 'trust me'
I can't believe this is true
Trust hurts
Why does trust equal suffering?
Suffering

My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust (in nothing we trust)

God help me please, on my knees
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much (so much)
Now there's nothing we trust (nothing we trust)

My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust (by lust)
We lied to each other so much (lied to each other so much)
That in nothing we trust

God help me please (help me please), on my knees
Betrayed by lust (lust)
We lied to each other so much
Absolutely nothing we trust!Mi nominee baphomet, come dance with me
Sacrifice the virgins, spiritual rites
Their master's time has come, the moon is full tonight

Drinking, dancing, they worship and toast
The devil, who's watching with demon's remote
Fire, rising, racing in your blood
Possessed, naive, his service is done

It's the Sabbath
Bloody Sabbath
Bad omen of the goat

Bloody blasphemy

Sinister's the word as the demon's take their fill
An orgy's taking place human blood will spill
An act of worship as they conceive the ghouls
Satan has their souls they sing pagan tunes

The ceremony is sure to be cursed
They wait for his blessings, but down comes the worst
Their bodies, soulless a corpse from the grave
Their minds are helpless and no one can save

No one can save
No one can save
No one can save, no one can know
No one can save, no one can knowFirst time you touched me
Secure and safe in open arms
I should have known you'd crush me

A snake you were when we met
I loved you anyway
Pulling out your poisoned fangs
The venom never goes away

Serpent swims free in my blood
Dragons sleeping in my veins
Jackal speaking with tongue
Roach egg laying in my brain

Once stalked beneath your shadow
Sleepwalking to the gallows
I'm the sun that beats your brow in
'Til I finally threw the towel in

Never knowing if I'd wake up
In a whirlpool got redundant
My brain was just some driftwood
In a cesspool, I became dead

From a rock star to a desk fool
Was my destiny, someone said
Loves a tidepool
Taste the waters
Life's abundant
Taste meTrapped in a dingy corporate cubicle hell
Then go to work in the darkness on the midnight shift
Any chance you get, selling gas at the corner Shell

Three letters groups listening in on you
Under surveillance courtesy of Big Brother in your car
Drones monitor each and every move you make
It doesn't matter who you know or who you think you are

You'll never see a ray of daylight
So far in debt you're struggling to survive
But you will break your back fighting and they'll help
Before you let them break your pride

"Powers that be" will never win; a storm is coming, get ready
You better learn to dance in the rain, instead of wait for the sun
Learn to dance in the rain, the sun will never come

Solo - Dave

Down on your luck, you had your hand out once or twice
But all you wanted was just a hand, they say
"You have the right to remain silent", so shut your mouth
Don't mention the broken promises and lies of hope and change

"Powers that be" will never win; a storm is coming, get ready
You better learn to dance in the rain, instead of wait for the sun
Learn to dance in the rain, the sun will never come

Solo - Chris

Never come, dance in the rain, it ain't gonna come

Solo - Dave

Enslave and impoverish the middle class
Make them dependent then strip it all away
Al-CIA-da, destruction, and democide
Addiction, corruption, every word's a lie

Races, classes, sexes, religious wars
Destroy the family, and what love is for

The Fed and the Bankers own all the politicians
May I introduce you to the sons of perdition?
Replace the dictators Washington appointed
The Devil Messiahs and the dangerously disappointed

They lie to themselves, pleased with what they've done
Soon they all will be repaid and there's nowhere to runOne hundred and one shots of opportunity, I'd gladly take them all again and again, and again

My angel's left me, sorrows are my own
Now I'm here, with the Devil on my own
Just like a churchyard shadow, creeping after me
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me

I promised on my soul, not to get carried away
It always starts out psychedelic, and then it turns to black
My head starts swaying, I forgot what it was that I was saying
I don't know where I am, and I'll never, never make it back

I sealed my fate, and I paid my debt
I fell from grace with deep regret

My angel's left me, sorrows are my own
And now I'm here, with the Devil on my own
Just like a churchyard shadow, creeping after me
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me
Just like a churchyard shadow, there's nothing left to see
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me

My angel's left me, sorrows are my own
Now I'm here, with the Devil on my own, on my own
Just like a churchyard shadow, creeping after me
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me
Just like a churchyard shadow, there's nothing left to see
It's only there to terrify my mind, a black swan keeps haunting me

Just like a churchyard shadow, creeping after me
There's nothing left to see, There's nothing left of meWe'd be going anywhere telling people
How to live?
Who'd believe we'd spend more
Shippin' drugs and guns
Than to educate our sons?
Sorry but that's what they did

I can't help but think
I can't help but think
I can't help but think
Someone's forsaken you and me

Luck deserted me and the truth
Beat out my brains
Men rise on stepping stones of their
Selves to higher things
I've stepped over lots of bodies on my way
Thanks for the information
Don't need no more anything

I can't help but think
I can't help but think
I can't help but think
Someone's forsaken you and me

We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We've been hung out to dry
You didn't want us anyway
And now we're making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives
We run for youthanasia

We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We've been hung out to dry
You didn't want us anyway
And now we're making up our minds
You tell us how to run our lives
We run for youthanasia

We are the damned of all the world
With sadness in our hearts
The wounded of the wars
We run for youthanasiaAs I'm taking all your money
I guess I should feel sorry
But I don't even trust me
There's bad news creeping up
And you feel a sudden chill
How do you do? My name is Trouble
I'm coming in for the kill...
In for the kill
And you know I will

Set the ball a-rollin'
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life o' style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There ain't no turning back

No horse ever ran as fast
As the money that you bet
I'm blowing all my cards
And I play them to my chest
Life's fabric is corrupt
Shot through with corroded thread
As for me I hocked my brains
Packed my bag and headed West
I hocked my brains
Headed West

Set the ball a-rollin'
I'll be clicking off the miles
On the train of consequences
My boxcar life o' style
My thinking is derailed
I'm tied up to the tracks
The train of consequences
There ain't no turning backCome get inside my head
Ooh the war of words
You're underneath my skin

You hate the way I wear my clothes
You hate my friends and where we go
I see you in the shadows
You think you know what's best for me
You hate everything you see in me
Have you looked in the mirror?

Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
Got so much more than theprice
I ain't gonna pay

You only point out fault
An anxiety attack
You're running you mouth
You stab me in my back

You hate the way I wear my clothes
You hate my friends and where we go
I see you in the shadows
You think you know what's best for me
You hate everything you see in me
Have you looked in the mirror?

Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
Got so much more than the price
I ain't gonna pay

Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
Got so much more than the price
I ain't gonna pay

Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway?
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?
Hey, just whose life is this anyway?White knuckles grasp at the wheel
I rush from an avalanche of adrenaline
It's all that I feel

As quick as a bolt of lightning
A rocket ride in a bucket seat
It doesn't get any better than this
It just feeds my need for speed

Supercharged, strapped in and screaming
Fire spitting from the pipes
A burnout by the flame-throwing fury
Eight thousand horses ignite
Full throttle, hit the ground running
With a tank full of nitro
And it's thirteen-twenty to go to the finish line

My hands hold tight
A fire breathing stampede
I fall into a trance
Hold my breath till the light turns green

In a cloud of nitro methane
Melting rubber, I say my prayers
Man and machine accelerate
When I vanish in thin air

Supercharged, strapped in and screaming
Fire spitting from the pipes
A burnout by the flame-throwing fury
Eight thousand horses ignite
Full throttle, hit the ground running
With a tank full of nitro
And it's thirteen-twenty to go to the finish lineDependability, made me a nervous wreck
Accountability, I live from check to check
Volatility, neglect and no respect

Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat
I hit the road to "I don't know" and look for "Tough Shit Street"

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho
Going nowhere everybody is a
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho
Moto Psycho

You know you can't resist to tell me what I mean
You gave my mind a twist said that I was unclean
The actor runs the play and ad-libs in between
You're all that I resent my thoughts were so obscene

Got my wheels in motion and I got a path to beat
I hit the road to "I don't know" and look for "Tough Shit Street"

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho
Going nowhere everybody is a
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto Psycho

One-way ticket nowhere there's no windows on this train
Can't see where I'm headed but I'm going there again

Moto Psycho
Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho
Going nowhere move it or lose it baby Moto Psycho
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour Moto Psycho
Where I'm headed I don't know but I'm shoving off and I hit the road
Going nowhere everybody is a Moto Psycho - time and time and time again I'm a
Moto Psycho
Moto Psycho move it or lose it baby
Going nowhere 100 miles an hour
Moto Psycho I'm a Moto PsychoThe one that ends it all
Hanging up, I wanted to cry
But dammit, this well's gone dry
Not for the money, not for the fame
Not for the power, just no more games

But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
I can't replace the lies, that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside
In her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

You'll grow to loathe my name
You'll hate me just the same
You won't need your breath
And soon you'll meet your death
Not from the years, not from the use
Not from the tears, just self abuse

But now I'm safe in the eye of the tornado
I can't replace the lies, that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside
In her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

Who's to say, what's for me to say?
Who's to say, what's for me to be?
Who's to say, what's for me to do?
Cause a big nothing it'll be for me

The land of opportunity
The golden chance for me
My future looks so bright
Now I think I've seen the light

Can't say what's on my mind
Can't do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
Is where I sleep, I really feel

I warn you of the fate
Proven true too late
Your tongue twist perverse
Come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain
I spin you round again
My poison fills your head
As I tuck you into bed

You feel my fingertips
You won't forget my lips
You'll feel my cold breath
It's the kiss of deathTo draw my thoughts, I'll gather and tell
Like bricks that I've laid to build my life
Those that crumbled only caused me strife

Thoughts became words, cast into the sea
But they returned, always haunting me
Like a severed arm washed up on the shore
I just don't think I can give anymore

Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?
Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
After everything, you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

At thirteen I started down this path
Fueled with anger, music was my wrath
Years of clawing at scars that never healed
Drowning my mind, the thoughts are too real

Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?
Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
After everything, you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

I can't get out; I can't jump out
Too much to face; I can't erase

Because I've lived, how many times do I have to die?
Because I've lived, how many lives do I have to die?

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for me
After everything, you still want me to bleed
Thirteen ways to see the devil in my eyes
Because I stood here thirteen times and I'm still alive

I can't get out; I can't jump out
Too much to face; I can't erase

Thirteen times and it's been lucky for meSomething's haunting me
The guilty past I've buried
My mind won't let me sleep

I'll do anything for peace - I keep waking up
A solemn oath I make
Cross my heart, please let me sleep - I keep waking up
How much more do I take

My head is talking to me
I don't know what it needs
But the loudest voice
Is the one I heed

Insomnia, my swollen bloodshot eyes
Insomnia, awake 'til morning light
Insomnia, stirring deep inside
Insomnia, somebody turn out the lights
I can't sleep - insomnia

I'm twisting and turning - I keep waking up
The madness I must tame
My candle is burning - I keep waking up
Both ends again today

The whole house is creaking
I know they're out there
The things kept from sight
I beg to the shadows
I can't sleep

Insomnia, footsteps on the walk
Insomnia, I hear someone knock
Insomnia, I wish it was a dream
Insomnia, can you hear me screamDream up your pain
Drink as did bacchus
Rebel just like cain 
Lord of the city
I shall remain 
All pandemonium
I shall reign 
Set in my fortress
Up on my hill 
Drinking the wine
Till I've had my fill 
Building up high
My castle walls 
Oh to veil my splendid fall 

I present you, I present to you
I present you, this crown of worms (2x)

Surrounding myself with misery
Drawn curtains heavy of my history
Exquisite I am perfect unity
On my left hand is false majesty
I feign affection, refute the true story 
Dispute with creation, the lie is my glory 
I care for no-one, my gospel is death 
For me the lights gone, only darkness is left 

I present you, I present to you
I present you, this crown of worms (2x)

As black in deed
As cold as stone
A commandment of one
As proud as gold 
As neglected in spirit
As time is old
As legion is numbers
As legend is told 
I am alone with the agony of truth 
My power of will
My judgement and chain
My end is knowledge 
And conscience of guilt
My final confusion hidden from me til I'm donePeople think that I'm insane because I'm frowning all the time

All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me?
Occupy my brain
Oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh, and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel, so love to me is so unreal

And so, as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could, but it's too late
It's too late
Too late

Dave: 
Nick:Get it right, terminate them
The Panzers will, permeate them
Break their pride, denigrate them
And their people, retrograde them
Typhus, deteriate them
Epidemic, devastate them
Take no prisoners, cremate them

Burn!

Going to war, give'em hell
D-Day, next stop - Normandy
Beginning of the end
We know how to and sure as shit we'll win
War is peace, sure man
A retreat for the damned
A playground for the demented
A haven for those who walk his world
Bereft of heart and soul

Love and war, they say all is fair
Take his life , but won't take his hair
Your body has parts your
Country can spare
By the way son here's
Your wheelchair

He once had to be
All he could be
Now he's nothing for no one nowhere to see
Funny thing, he's like you and me
It's funny thing, a funny thing
Tears streak
His solemn stare
Abandoned for wreckage nobody cares
No one knew what would happen there
No one spoke, no one even dared
Don't ask what you can do for your country
Ask what your country can do for you

Take no prisoners, take no shitI cause millions of accidents, I am cancer in your bones
I fathered the lie, twist what you say, speak not the truth
I am insidious, impartial, deep inside your chromosomes

I take what you love, and leave you in tears
I imprison your soul, your hopes are my games
I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain
While you burn at the stake, I dance with the flames

I bring poverty, sickness and death
A worthless handshake, the slickest thief, I steal your wealth
I answer your prayers for greed and lust
More than evil, I laugh at your trust

I am more powerful than all the armies of the world
I am more violent than violence, more deadly than death
I have destroyed more men than all the nation's wars
I am relentless, unpredictable, waiting for your last breath

(Evil) More evil than violence
(Violent) More violent than death
(Deadly) More deadly than man
(I am) Yeah yeah, I'm evil, I am

My kingdom corrupt with dissent
Your sins erupt by my intent
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin
Let the nightmare begin
Prince of darkness, your satanic highness
Prince of darkness, the devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness

I take what you love, and leave you in tears (leave you, in tears)
Imprison your soul, your hopes are my games (your hopes, my games)
I strip you of pride, my promise is in vain (promise, in vain)
While you burn at the stake (at the stake, at the stake) I dance with the flames

My kingdom corrupt with dissent
Your sins erupt by my intent
I loathe your prayer, I wallow in sin
Let the nightmare begin
Prince of darkness, your satanic highness
Prince of darkness, the devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness

Prince of darkness, your satanic highness
Prince of darkness, the most beautiful angel
Prince of darkness, the devilish serpent, the dreaded Lucifer
Prince of darkness, unpredictable, the prince of darkness
Prince of darknessMy life is standing still
It's clear that fate is closing in
But this is the life I choose
I've got so much time to kill
Born to lose, I'll die to win

Burn, baby burn... 'cause it feels so good

I'm getting on my own nerves
And I get no satisfaction
Till I light it up and burn it down
One match lights my fire
And it starts a chain reaction
That burns my crooked past to the ground

Burn, baby burn... 'cause it feels so good
Burn, baby burn... like I knew it would
Fire, I've got the fire
Fire, burning desire... my desire to burn

Solo - Dave

I hear the darkness call
The sirens are growing near
It's time I make my great escape
The flames are getting tall
Inside my rear view mirror
Just a spark is all it takesHey, I don't feel so good
Something's not right
Something's coming over me
What the fuck is this?
Whoa

Killer, intruder, homicidal man
You see me coming, run fast as you can
A bloodthirsty demon is stalking the street
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat
Bloodthirsty demon, sinister fiend
Bludgeonous slaughters, my evil deed

My hammer's a cold piece of blood-lethal steel
I grin while you writhe with the pain that I deal
Swinging the hammer, I hack through their heads
Defiant defilers, you're next to be dead
I unleash my hammer with sadistic intent
Pounding, surrounding, slamming through your head, yeah

The bodies convulse in agony and pain
I mangle their faces till no features remain
A blade for the butchering, I cut them to shreds
First take out the organs, then cut off the head
Remains of flesh now sop under my feet
One more bloody massacre, the murder's complete
I seek to dismember a sadist fiend
Bloodbaths are my way of getting clean
I lurk in the alley, wait for the kill
I have no remorse for the blood that I spill

A merciless butcher that lives underground
I'm out to destroy and I will cut you down
Cut you down
I see you and I'm waiting for Black Friday

Cut me loose
Killer, intruder, homicidal man
If you see me coming, run fast as you can
A bloodthirsty demon who's stalking the street
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat
Bloodthirsty demon, sinister fiend
Bludgeonous slaughters, my evil deed

A merciless butcher who lives underground
I'm out to destroy and I will cut you down

It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the wall
It's Black Friday, paint the devil on the, devil on the, devil on the wallDon't come to join with me
For Death surely wants you
With sharp and pointy teeth

An animal so vicious
No others fought and won
So on the fields of battle
We are the chosen ones

Human bones blanket the dirt
Of the heathen's lair
That we must pass this den of death
The only path from here

But I walk in the light
The time to die has come
No one shall take my life
I'm of the chosen ones

Black shadows fill the sky
As the creatures eyes grow near
Raise the shield of the holy pilgrims
High into the air

Heaven's powers fill my arms
Onward now to fight I'm sent
Oh the beast is coming
To put you to the test

Look out!
Now this land is mine to pillage
Rape, and steal, and take at will
Never let you cross this path
I reign, for now, I stay to kill

You doubt your strength or courage
Don't come to join with me
For Death surely wants you
With sharp and pointy teeth

An animal so vicious
No others fought and won
So on the fields of battle
We are the chosen onesI pray the lord my soul to keep
If I should die (just) before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take

I'm not going to wake up today
They've pulled my plug, the picture fades
And as my body decays
Mold begins to fill my grave
The smell of death permeates
The silk within my coffin lays

Go to hell!

As they bury me now
Six feet, there my body lies
Still feel like I'm going down
I hear a distant wailing cry
God, something must have gone wrong!
Much too late, I realize

Go to hell!

I saw my funeral that day
I know who didn't show to mourn
My judgment was life in hell
Pillars of pain and thorns
My only friends the goat
With 666 between his horns

Go to hell!

Place all your trust here in me
Rest assured these things I know
And as Charon sails the sea
Your journey, too shallow below
Ah yes! You're all sitting ducks
It's true - you reap what you sow

Go to hell!

Now I lay me down to sleep
Blah blah blah, my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
I'll go to hell for heaven's sake!That I got for you
Is the one thing
That you never do

One thing makes you feel brand new
Is the one thing that you're coming to
Just the one thing
Gets you in the mood

You call my number in the middle of the night
To tell me nothing else can make you feel all right
But it rings and rings, you hang it up
And call me back again

One thing
That I got for you
Is the one thing
That you never do

One thing
That you got to choose
Is the one thing you can never lose
Just the one thing is your attitude

You call my name in the middle of the night
When you're makin' love and it feels all right
But it's him, not me
Can't you see a shot of reality?

I know what you do
I know what you want to do
I know when the lights go out
I know what you are gonna do

One thing
That I got for you
Is the one thing
That you never do

Just the one thing gets you in the mood
Just the one thing, it's your attitude
One thing is one thing
Just the one thing
OhCold as hell, black as spades, aware of my immediate surroundings
In my place, I escape up into my hideout
Hiding from everyone, my friends all say, "Dave, you're mental anyway, hey"
Drift into a deeper state, stalk the cobwebbed stairways
Dirt grits beneath my feet, the stair creaks, I precariously sneak, yeah

Hypnosis guides my hand, I slip-slide through the walkways
Sit in granny's rocking chair, memories are whirling by, yeah
Reminiscin' in the attic, Lucretia waits impatiently
Cobwebs make me squint, the cobra so eloquently glints
Moonbeams surge through the sky, the crystal ball is energized
Surely that, like the cat, waiting, Lucretia rocks away, heyAnd put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch peoples heads a'roll
A'roll, a'roll

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swayin' to the symphony
Of destruction

Actin' like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes, explodes

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swayin' to the symphony
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swayin' to the symphony
Swayin' to the symphony
Of destruction

The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
Oh warrin' for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
A'tall, a'tall

Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swayin' to the symphony
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swayin' to the symphony
Swayin' to the symphony
Of destructionTake control, untouchable just like God above
I can't escape, wrapped in red tape, what will become of me?
If I object, then I defect, my country 'tis of thee

The White House is calling
Tell them I'll call them back
Just tell them anything
Yeah, get them off my back

The world needs a hero

Not that I would ever lie but I have no choice
Words I say heard today are not mine, just my voice

NATO is on line one
They want to talk to me
Tell them that I'm not in
Tell them that I'm not free

The world needs a hero

Phantom rule, the hidden jewel
Who's really in control?
On puppet strings, a nation swings
Undermined by moles

The UN is on hold
Tell them I'll call them back
Yeah, tell them anything
Just get them off my back

The world needs a hero

Dave, the White House is calling
They want to talk to me
Tell them that I can't be bought
Tell them that I'm not free

The world needs a heroIt's what you've been waiting for
All the blood, sweat, and tears getting ready
For this one moment, for this one shot

All eyes are focused on you
Everyone is now watching, waiting
It seems the world has stopped turning
The clock's spinning, and you better not blow it

This is the deciding factor
Your personal "come to Jesus" moment
Where they separate winners and losers
Ask yourself; do I really want this bad enough?

I've got to prove myself
I'll turn the night a' light
I'll set this place on fire
I know tonight's the night

There are millions of reasons you should give up
Each one just waiting for you to wash out
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity
Soldier on and drown out the sounds of defeat

The world is yours to take, abandon your "plan B"
Seize everything you've ever wanted
Because for those who think winning comes easy
Luck will be their last dying wish

I've got to prove myself
I'll turn the night a' light
I'll set this place on fire
I know tonight's the nightA legion of uneducated, bankrupt souls
With a lust for revenge, answering the call
From New Yorqatar to Califorabia

Desperation provides fertile ground for religious extremism
This glorious brainwashing where prejudice lies
Like a crouching tiger
Tormenting peasants till they erect an army
Under everyone's nose
In the end propaganda destroys their DNA, god help them

All that they envisioned of what things would come to be
Turned into a pink mist when they blew to smithereens
We are just a war away from Amerikhastan
When God versus god; the undoing of man

Promising a vapor, in the end they become one

No rules of engagement, this enemy hides
Amongst women and children
And to beat violence, you must ignore the focus groups
You must send in the Mossad, turn off the BBC, CNN
and don't look back
Rest assured there'll be no more Middle Eastern crisis, hell!
There'll be no more Middle East!

These are your people Lady Liberty
Pull up your dress today
And tattooed is "Property of the USA
A subsidiary of Halliburton"
Surprise?!
But a roaring lion is about to be unleashed on earth
Hey, Jihad Joe? Guess what? We're coming to get you!

All that you envision of what things will come to be
Turns into a death knell when you look behind the scenes
We are just a war away from Amerkhastan
When God versus god; the undoing of manFull of pride, a heavy load 
You eat yourself, gluttony 
Resent yourself, you envy me 

Everything turns into wrath 
You lust yourself to death 

Deep fears that drive us 
They're hid beneath disguises 
Judge the world within
Or forgive my deadly sins 

Procrastination, always giving up 
Something better comes to interrupt 
Cast your verdict down to me 
Spare me your bleeding sympathy 

Only care how you appear 
Clearly see you can't see clear 

Deep fears that drive us 
Hid beneath disguises 
Judge the world within 
Forgive my deadly sins 

Greed, gluttony, pride, envy, wrath, sloth, lust, deadly seven 
Seven deadly sins of mine 

On every street and corner lie 
These seven deadly sins of mineBattle scars in disarray
A simple man, power drunk
No worries of living, no more anything

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Bastards possesses to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the evil that's within?

Pyramids of dead men and dogs
Spoils of war so they say
Once burned, forever marked
Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay

Deep inside I've seen it rise
Bastards possesses to no end
Mirror, mirror, please look inside
Do you see the evil that's within?

Pressure coming down
Down on me, gonna break
Broken fingernails
Digging in, scratch your face

Nervous, like a cat
Gonna jump through my skin
Shadows on the wall
Stretching out, grope for me

Evil, evil
Evil, deep in me
Evil, let me be
Evil, let me bleed
Evil, set me free
Evil, set me free
Evil, set me free
The evil that's withinThat locks the door to this hell, the place they wanted me
Time's racing like the wind, execution's near
Oh Lord, I wait for death and, yes, I have no fear

I recall that night, my every breath and step along the way
Closed my eyes, walking as danger paved the way
The devil and the darkness, let her evil wander free
Here on Devil's Island, the final stop for me

Devil's Island
Devil's Island

Oh, there is no escape, the sea is full of sharks
The tide takes you away and smashes you on the rocks
The sun is shining but feel not today
It's warmth, it's dying and fading away

Devil's Island
Here I stay, Devil's Island

Oh, hear the call from the grave beyond
Oh, so pernicious, her soul it creates song
As there is no man, that is here upon the earth
Labeled to terminate our noisome Lucifer

The priest that reads the sermons is walking next to me
To the stake, my last request to have her burn with me
And so it did, the heavens opened, rain began to fall
The final judgment came, and was spread before you all

Final judgment

Old, weak, and feeble and the lessons taught to me
To stay away from evil, she doesn't care for me
She haunts me in my sleep though I tore that page away
And here on Devil's Island, I'll always have to stay

Devil's Island
Devil's Island
Devil's Island
Devil's Island, here I am

Devil's Island, Devil's Island
Devil's Island, Devil's Island
Devil's Island, Devil's Island
Devil's Island, Devil's IslandI'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind
And I'm still awake... Mary Jane

From the earth, up through the trees
I can hear her calling me
Her voice rides on the breeze
Oh, it's haunting me

No, I can't get away
No, there's no escape
If I know I'm going crazy
I must not be insane

Beware my friends, as you pass by
As you are now so once was I
As I am now so you must be
Prepare my friends to follow me

Forgive me father, for I have sinned
I'm a child of the air, I'm a witch of the wind
Fingers gripped around my brain
No control, my mind is lame
I'm in the astral plane, and I'll never be the same
Never, never, never, never, never, never
Never, never, never

Beware my friends, as you pass by
As you are now so once was I
As I am now so you must be
Prepare my friends to follow me

It hurts so bad I can't breathe
Prepare to follow meWho do you... who do you think you are?
Some kind of superstar? We'll see!
Where do you... where do you think you are?
That shit won't get you far with me

You're just so dashing, you marvel at the sound
Of your own voice, as you crash into the ground

You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified, the emperor has no clothes

Just so you know, that's how it goes!

You're bad... you're bad for my health
Because you make me sick, you prick
Don't you know... don't you know who I am?
You know I like your face, to kick

If your lips are moving, I know you must be lying
You even suck the life out of dying

You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified, the emperor has no clothes

The house of cards a' falling, luck is running thin
Father forgive him, being a punk is not a sin

You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified, the emperor has no clothes

You look so perfect, perfect, the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, perfect, the emperor has no clothes
And everybody knows... except youThat double life of yours has left your whole world shaking
Who are you fooling?
I know you hear the laughter
Don't you hear people talking?
What is it your after?
Ooh

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's real so you just Disconnect

The key to save yourself if for nothing else
A tongue can never hold the truth of silence is golden
With a broken heart
Underneath all of the pain
Do you stroke the pretty scars?
The hurt never ends, ooh

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's real so you just Disconnect

-Solo-

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's real (that anything's real)
So you just Disconnect

Turn off your conscience
Leave the world outside
Nothing at all can ever make you feel
That anything's real so you just DisconnectAnd headed for the big race
I felt a chill on my backbone
As I hung up the telephone

Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
To lose means trouble, to win pays double
And I got me a heavy bet
Cold, cold sweat

They say chances on the outside
Are looking pretty slim
I feel so lucky on the inside
I feel I'm going to win

Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
Take a little money, there's nothing left to lose
And I got me a heavy bet
Cold, cold sweat

I've got a whole month's wages
I haven't seen that much in ages
I might spend it in stages
And move out to Las Vegas

Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
To lose means trouble, to win pays double
And I got me a heavy bet
Cold, cold sweat

I put my money in a suitcase
They say chances on the outside
I've got a whole month's wages

Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Stone cold crazy, place another betAnd all the reasons I give you to bitch
And how I make you wanna scream in pain
And feel your life is just a losing game

I like the way that you let me in
The way you look when the walls cave in
I like the way that your stomach knots
And how you cry for it all to stop

I like the way that you fool yourself
And make believe there's nobody else
I like the way that you stand in line
And beg salvation from the empty skies
Empty skies

Don't want no revenge
Ain't no pay back time
It ain't called getting even
Here comes the reckoning
Day
Day
Day
Day

I like the things that you try to fake
And your face when I see you break
And that you say you will pray for me
You realize, you are prey for me

I like the way you stay on attack
No matter what, I keep coming back
And how you try to hold me down
But you end up driven to the ground
To the ground

Don't want no revenge
Ain't no pay back time
It ain't called getting even
Here comes the reckoning

Don't want no revenge (don't want no revenge)
Ain't no pay back time (ain't no pay back time)
It ain't called getting even (it ain't called getting even)
Here comes the reckoning
Here comes the reckoning
Day
Day
Day

Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning day
Here comes the reckoning day

Here comes the reckoning
Here comes the reckoning day
Ooh, here it comes
It's coming to get yaAt mach speed we engage
Feeding people's rage
The big cat's left its cage
Back in the bus again
To catch another plane
This behavior's quite insane
But we do it for the fame, yeah

I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road

The road will never end
It always starts again
Another show's around the bend
Another long lost friend
Faceless as the snow
There's nothing special about the road
It's just another haul
It's just too damn long that's all, yeah

I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road

I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing road
I lost my mind
I lost all my money
I lost my life to the killing roadIt won't be long till they replace me
And nothing seems to faze me, anymore

I can't take it, I get the feeling I won't make it
I'm feeling bad and I can't shake it
And now I'm living just to fake it, what's more

Which way is right? Come with me
Which way is wrong? Come with me
Which way is up? Come with me
Which way is down?

Crazy, I'm going crazy, this world's gone crazy
I'm falling off the edge

Lately, I wake each morning feeling beat
And now there's panic in the street
Someone keeps turning up the beat everywhere

Every day, I'm like an actor on the stage
I'll never let you see my rage
I'm not at peace out of my cage anywhere

Which way is right? Come with me
Which way is wrong? Come with me
Which way is up? Come with me
Which way is down?

Crazy, I'm going crazy, this world's gone crazy
I'm falling off the edge
Crazy, We're going crazy, this world's gone crazy
We're falling off the edge

Lately, I can't believe the things I see
This ignorance and apathy
Brings out the lunatic in me, if you care?

It blows my mind, when you sneak off into the night
Maybe it's better that you lie
Just don't forget to say goodbye, if you dare?

Crazy, I'm going crazy, this world's gone crazy
I'm falling off the edge
Crazy, We're going crazy, this world's gone crazy
We're falling off the edgeI am an Antichrist
I am an anarchist
I know what I want and
I know how to get it
I wanna destroy passerby

'Cause I wanna be anarchy
In the city

Anarchy for the U.S.A
It's coming sometime maybe
I give a wrong time stop a traffic line
Your future dream is a shopping scheme

'Cause I wanna be anarchy
In the city,

How many ways
To get what you want?
I use the best, I use the rest
I use the enemy, I use anarchy

'Cause I wanna be anarchy
It's the only way to be

Problem
Problem, have you got a problem?
Problem,

Too many problems, oh why am I here?
I need to be me, 'cause you're all too clear
And I can see there's something wrong with you
Oh, what do you expect me to do?

Bet you thought, you had it all worked out
Bet you thought, you knew what I was about
Bet you thought, you'd solved all your problems
But you are the problem

The problem is you
So, what you gonna do?
It's a problem, I'll leave it to you
Problem, the problem is you
You got a problem
So, what you gonna do?

Is this the MPLA?
Or is this the UDA?
Or is this the IRA
I thought it was the U.S.A
Or just another country
Another council tenancy

'Cause I wanna be anarchy
In the city,

'Cause I wanna be anarchy
'Cause I wanna be anarchy
You know what I mean
'Cause I wanna be anarchy
Anarchist
DestroyIt doesn't matter where you sleep at night, she'll wreck it
It doesn't matter where you go to work
Doesn't matter where you go to church
Doesn't matter just how bad it hurts, she'll wreck it

My bleached bones in the desert, it's all that's left of me

Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much
Home wrecker
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this
Home wrecker

It doesn't matter what you pretend, she'll wreck it
It doesn't matter what you defend, she'll wreck it
It doesn't matter how you live your life
Doesn't matter anymore to your wife
Doesn't matter even how you die, she'll wreck that too

Like a vulture picking my bones clean, it's all that's left of me

Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much
Home wrecker
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this
Home wrecker

It doesn't matter where you live
It doesn't matter what you drive
Home wrecker

Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much
Home wrecker
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this
Home wreckerFull tank, pockets lined with cash
Full throttle, gonna rip some ass
Drive all day, and through the night
Romance the road, winding left and right
The stars above guide me, the moonlight is free
A feeling inside me, and the whole world to see

Driving fast makes me feel good
The speed of light trapped under my hood
Breaking laws, 'cause there's nothing to do
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502

Hundreds of miles rolled off today
Signs lose their meaning, minutes tick away
Dirt roads to interstates, I must have drove them all
Cigarettes and burgers, caffeine and alcohol

Drive until daybreak, always on the go
Life on the freeway, night shift till dawn patrol

Driving fast makes me feel good
The speed of light trapped under my hood
Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502
Stopped for a 502, next time it's gonna be you

Stars above guide me
This feeling inside me
I drive until daybreak
Life on the freeway is hell
I'm coming throughWith confidence I tread through the dead of the night
Off to another wartorn, faraway battlefield
Wherein lies a daemonic enemy horde

On this day I desire to anoint my fists
Engaging them in the mode of power and war
Stopping at nothing that's short of fulfilling my destiny
Willing to die and I will, after you for what I believe

A desperate avenger striking fear in their hearts
Invading their dreams before the day even starts

Whet with your blood, I sharpen my sword
No turning the other cheek like a coward
Come tomorrow, I may lay down and die
But not this day

Sent on an unholy quest, to reduce all those who resist
To the size of their shriveled up souls and scatter them like grist
I vanquished the strangleholds that the netherworld sets for me
The last request of my life is to die killing my enemies

Bathed in blood up to the horse's bridle
It's death to retreat, there's no chance of survival

Whet with your blood, I sharpen my sword
No turning the other cheek like a coward
Come tomorrow I may lay down and die
But not this day, this day we fight!

This day we fight!

Strip the fallen heroes, finish off the wounded
Collect the spoils of war and send them back dead

This day we fight!
This day I fight!Flowing constantly
My broken body is a wreck
Wrapped around a tree
A crosswalk hit and run
The finish line for me
People clutter in the gutter
Take a look and see

No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging onto life
By the skin o' my teeth

My blood flows through the streets
Deluge from the wounds
Empty jars of sleeping pills
On the dresser in my room
My wet brain neighbor cranes
His neck to see in time
The white lights a train
Bearing down on me

No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o' my teeth

I won't feel the hurt
I'm not trash any longer
That that doesn't kill me
Only makes me stronger
I need a ride to the morgue
Thats what 911 is for
So, tag my toe and don't forget
Ooh, to close the drawer

No escaping pain
You belong to me
Clinging on to life
By the skin o' my teethMany centuries ago
Came the spawning of Christ
And the Antichrist
And darkness fell upon our people
And the children, they
were born faceless
Without eyes they could not see
Born unto themselves
They lived and they died
In the Millennium of the BlindIn perpetual writhing 
The primordial ooze 
And the sanity they lose 

Awakened in the morning 
To more air pollution warnings 
Still we sleepwalk off to work 
While our nervous systems jerk 

Pretending not to notice 
How history had forebode us 
With the greenhouse in effect 
Our environment was wrecked 

Now I can only laugh 
As I read our epitaph 
We end our lives as moles 
In the dark of dawn patrolAnd my prayers are never answered
But you'll never see the pain inside of me
Stabbing me over and over and over
I trusted you and I loved you
And you spit back in my face
How could you do this to me?
When will you stop trying to hurt me?
I've walked a minefield for you
A career in hell with you
I have made it through the things
Others would surely die just watching
And the oath I take on this day
Is to know that you will be repaid
One day the the sun will die and the night will crawl
Until then, until I see your world implode
I wish you death and suffering
Misery to spare
Time to rehearse your pain
Face the last enemy
I am the last thing you will know
The last thing you will see
I see your death surrounding me
I know you, yes I do
I know you

When no words are spoken and pleas are ignored
Your tears go unnoticed, will you say enough?
When prayers are unanswered and your calls are unheard
The pain cuts right through you, have you seen enough?

It all seems so deceitful and the verdict is lies
A black cloud of indecision compromised your life

When judgement has failed you
When your own heart's impaled you
Your wandering mind has destroyed you
Will you ever know when?

When you give everything and the feeling is gone
All the giving is fake, did you fake enough?
When you take everything and you stay too long
When there's nothing left, did you take enough?Another gunman will come seeking my defeat 
Will he be as fast as me, are his nerves quiet and still 
Will he fall like all the rest 
Ending his days upon boothill 

I'm an outcast riding into town alone 
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone 
I'm an outcast riding into town alone 
I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone 

As I ride into the sunset to take another town 
Thank you for the invite, but I just can't settle down 
The dust that coats my hat is from a dozen towns 
Dust from shooting down another dozen clowns 

I'm an outcast riding into town alone 
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone 
I'm an outcast riding into town alone 
I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone 

A drum beats for me, it's louder every day 
The cadence tells me that soon I'll meet my judgement day

My judgement day...

A drum beats for me, it gets louder every day
The cadence tells me that soon I'll meet my judgement day 

Life's an endless showdown 
Never knowing when they'll come 
I sleep with one eye open lying with my smoking gun 

The game I play has caused a lot of grief 
They were dying for fame, so I obliged them some relief 
They were dying for fame, I obliged them some relief

I'm an outcast riding into town alone 
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone 
I'm an outcast with lightning in my hand 
I got wanderlust lost in no man's land 
I got a lust for wandering lost in no man's land 
I got wanderlustTo swallow alive some harmless souls
Walking a crooked path, their wicked names will rot

Evil lives in the dark, its right is doing wrong
The torment never ends . . . it never ends

The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane

Trapped in this "no man's land"
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned to the realms
Of the Never Dead

There's no one trust from this grave
Die with those they swear to defend
Feeding on the ones they'll feed off in the end

Evil lives in the dark, its right is doing wrong
The torment never ends . . . it never ends

The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane

Trapped in this "no man's land"
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned to the realms
Of the Never Dead

Death sits before you, to press on is suicide
Life spills out of your body, you wither and die
For the rest of your life in the realms of the Never Dead

The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane

Trapped in this "no man's land"
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned to the realms
Of the Never DeadI hope the end is less painful than my life
I stand on trial before the gods on Judgment Day
A blink of an eye between the cradle and the grave

One last look at visions of flesh 
The last best hope of man on earth 
Pontius Pilate still washing his hands 
The world don't want to be saved, only left alone

 We are storming the heavens
 To raise the swords and shields
 We ascend to our destiny
 To the Elysian Fields

Soaring to the sun with blood upon their wings
Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind
Man still has one belief, one decree that stands alone
The laying down of arms is like cancer to their bones

One last look at visions of flesh 
The last best hope of man on earth 
Pontius Pilate still washing his hands 
The world don't want to be saved, only left alone

 We are storming the heavens
 To raise the swords and shields
 We ascend to our destiny
 To the Elysian Fields

 We are storming the heavens
 To raise the swords and shields
 We ascend to our destiny
 To the Elysian Fields
  We are storming the heavens
  To raise the swords and shields
  We ascend to our destiny
 To the Elysian FieldsHe maketh me to lie down in green pastures 
He leadeth me beside the still waters 
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me 
In the paths of righteousness for his name's sake 
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me 
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies 
Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over 
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life 
And I will dwell in the house of the LORD for everFeel at home in our black conventicle
As we anathematize all of those who oppose us

Don't summon the devil
Don't call the priests
If you need the strength
The conjuring, obey

Behold the flames rise from the compasses' cardinal points
Burn the sacred oil and, with the ashes, you'll anoint

Arrange the symbols of the wizard and magician
Light the candles, place the parchment paper in position
Between its leaves, place the lash from a black cat's eye
A straw of a broom, fold and burn and centralize

Don't summon the devil
And don't call the priests
If you need the strength
The conjuring

I am the devil's advocate, a salesman if you will
You know my name
You know my name

I met your father years ago, gave him what he'd please
He called my name
You'll do the same

I'm claiming what is mine by right, it's time to close the deal
You're bought and sold
Bought and sold

Come join me in my infernal depths, Mephisto's hall of fame
I've got your soul
I've got your soul

The conjuring
ObeyI'm winding down, I'm growing tired
Seconds drift into the night
The clock just ticks till my time expires

You were once my friend
Now I know I can't tie your hands
The days I saved I couldn't spend
They fell like sand through the hourglass
No time to lose, no time to choose

Time taking time, it's taken mine
Scenes of my life seem so unkind
Time chasing time, creeps up behind
I can't run forever, and time waits for no one
Not even me

I heard somebody fixed today
There was no last goodbyes to say
His will to live ran out
I heard somebody turned to dust
Looking back at what he left
A list of plans and photographs
Songs that never will be sung
These are the thinge he won't get done

I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use that man

Just one shot to say goodbye
One last taste to mourn and cry
Scores and shoots, the lights go dim
Just one shot to do him in

He hangs his head and wonders why
Why the monkey only lies
But pay the pauper, he did choose
He hung his head inside the noose

I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use that man
I've seen them crawl from the cradle to the coffin on their hands
They fight a war but it's fatal, it's so hard to understand
I've seen the man use the needle, seen the needle in his hand
Cryptic writing on the wall, the beginning of the end
I've seen myself use the needle, seen the needle in my handOne day you're here and then you're gone
This is the moment I've lived my whole life for
And I'll never give up; I've waited too long

I've waited, waited too long
I've waited too long

And all along the road, all the bodies left behind
May all have been good friends; just not good friends of mine

I've been kicked out and said I quit
Then I said, "I had enough" and "This is it"
All I wanted was just one more show for the road
'Cause it was over last time before I could blink, I could blink

I've waited, waited too long
I've waited too long

And all along the road, all the bodies left behind
May all have been good friends; just not good friends of mine

Their bodies left behindKilling for religion, something I don't understand
Fools like me, who cross the sea and come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep, for their beliefs, do you kill on God's command?

A country that's divided, surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace, no foolish naive stand
The end is near, it's crystal clear, part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel, it might be your homelands
Holy wars

Upon my podium, as the know-it-all scholar
Down in my seat of judgment, gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holier-than-thou could-be messenger of God

Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, repel down the rocks, behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me
Some people live to destroy me
Either way they die
They die

They killed my wife and my baby with hopes to enslave me
First mistake, last mistake
Paid by the alliance to slay all the giants
Next mistake, no more mistakes

Fill the cracks in with judicial granite
Because I don't say it don't mean I ain't thinkin' it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings, mercy killings
Mercy killings, killings, killings, killings
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts awayin a rhetoric of equals
No such things as hell, not heaven, continues,
The code of annihilation confronts with social attack
As the flames of death are filled with brains in flux intact
No one would ever die too soon
Before the beginning of the baby boom
And before the beginning of an era in gubernatorial rhetoric
The rules of death and brutal attack while most men rise from the sick
The mortal path of greed and demonic inaction 
Is about to be destroyed by demons attacking each other's adoration

This is the code of annihilation
Putting an end to devastation and distraction

(Repeat chorus)

And now, let demonic combat reign intact
Before male human mercenaries are ready to attack evil fallout
But it is not every male human being's fault

This is the code of annihilation
Putting an end to devastation and distraction

(Repeat chorus)

And now, let demonic combat reing intact
Before male human mercenaries are ready to attack evil fallout
But it is not every male human being's fault

This is the code of annihilation
Putting an end to devastation and distractionBut rest assured, they're out there and they're coming
If you listen, the sound is growing nearer of infantry
Marching out a hypnotizing rhythm

Destroying every town, light it up and burn it down
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends

Above the ring of clashing steel, they raise flags of war
A sign to all the warriors who cannot hear
Amidst smoke of cannonballs, they bang the drums of death
Pound a cadence out for those who cannot see

Destroying every town, light it up and burn it down
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends
Poison the wells and scorch the earth, everything's slashed and burnt
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends

Destroying every town, light it up and burn it down
You may not like it now, but this is how the story ends
Poison the wells and scorch the earth, everything's slashed and burnt
You may not like it now, but this is how the story endsEmbers of avarice soon begin to soar
Vengeance breeding greater vengeance, two eyes for one eye
Crowning burning hatred that’s lying deep inside

A token gift, destroyers deep within its hold
Revenge of patient men is sweet and best served cold
The enemy inside the belly of the beast
A mighty Trojan horse, tonight the sentries sleep

On the march... No place to run
Time has come... No where to hide
The moon is red... No one is safe
From spilling blood... no living thing survives

Here they fight... regretting nothing
Here you die... the walls are caving in
Nothing left... a lethal encounter
Its judgment time... when death comes from within

Warning signs ignored, they have all but been denied
Prophets and messengers, mocked and vilified
Final destination lying deep inside their court
Their first line of defense soon became their last resort

Hardened deceivers entered through their open gates
Silent trained assassins, lying still, in wait

You look so perfect, but everybody knows
Their petrified to say the emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
Their just so petrified, the emperor has no clothes

Death from within...Wizard, all knowing, all wise

I want to rule this kingdom
Make sweet the breeze, now defiled

Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists
In velvet gloves of sin

Parade the grey robed monks
Those vestal virgins, wheel the wyverns in

Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage
Let me be the protege of five magics

Give me alchemy, give me wizardry
Give me sorcery, thermatology
Electricity, magic if you please
Master all of these, bring him to his knees

I master five magics
I master five magics
I master five magics
I master five magics

Possessed with hellish torment (Possessed with hellish torment)
I master magics five (I master magics five)
Hunting the abyss lord (Hunting the abyss lord)
Only one will stay alive (Only one will stay alive)

He who lives by the sword (He who lives by the sword)
Will surely also die (Will surely also die)
He who lives in sin (He who lives in sin)
Will surely live the lieMultiple personalities
Terror inside of me
A mask of silent agony

Curse the falling rain
The vortex of pain

As medieval as Merlin
A pact for power was made
Lucifer in transition
It's time, time the price was paid

Scorching the domain
The vortex of pain

A telestic message
Written in torment
Howl out dirges
Like the horns of Jericho
Distorted faces writhing in rage
Walls of purgatory tumble down
Endless death
The jewels of a crown
The jewels of a crownThe tigers eat their young...
The body stayed but inside the head,
The mind was on the run.
A conspiracy of silence.
The only way out of pain,
Is turn around, run through it man !
Too wet to come in from the rain...
Tell them...

I know they were doing it to you...
But don't try doing it to me !

Let me show you, how I love you,
It's our secret, you and me
Let me show you, how I love you,
But keep it in the family...

When you hear them saying "trust me",
Don't wait to see what's next...
Thrown to the wolves forever trusting
Raised in a form of living hell.
Sing a one note song of rage
Live and die within your heart
So beware in the shadows,
Your family tree waits in the dark
I say...

I know they were doing it to you...
But don't try doing it to me ! No! No!...

Let me show you, how I love you,
It's our secret, you and me.
Let me show you, how I love you,
But keep it in the family tree.
Let me show you, how I love you,
It's our secret, you and me.
Let me show you, how I love you,
The secret ... of the family tree...Better left for dead
And now we are on a mission
Well, it's full speed ahead
My legions, when we do the crime
Let's get one thing straight
To get there early is on time
And showing up on time is late

Ladies and gents
We're still alive
By the skin of our teeth
Now it's killing time
Angel in our pocket
Devil by our side
We ain't going nowhere, 'cause heroes never die

 Blood of heroes
 They never die
 Blood of heroes
 They never die

We've been run down every hill
Chased up all the dead end streets
But if you try to cut us out
You'll get a kick in the teeth

Ladies and gents
We're still alive
By the skin of our teeth
Now it's killing time
Fasten up your head belts
It's time to ride the skies
It's time to be immortal, 'cause heroes never die

 Blood of heroes
 They never die
 Blood of heroes
 They never die

Blood of heroes
Blood of heroes
Blood of heroes
They never die
 Blood of heroes
 Blood of heroes
 Blood of heroes
 Blood of heroesAnd you fit like a glove
That is no way to live
That is no way to love
Full of fear in your skin
And the weakness in giving in

You're stabbed in the back
But you feel no pain
Push the heaviest doors
That you can't open
Yeah, they tied me up
And my body lies still again

You're as bright as the sun
And as calm as the moon
I don't know when you'll break
But it's gonna be soon
If my will caves in
I'll be in the same boat as you

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand
"The meaning of"

Hands on strings
And my mouth open
Find the perfect words
That I've not spoken
And I won't tell the truth
Unless you want me to

For all of the times
That I lost my head
When it rolled to the floor
And I found it again
But when it came back
No, I didn't know my own name

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand
"The meaning of"

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand

I've got the salt skin
Running to where he is
Never going to give in
Even with the strength
He's stealing salt skin
Telling me I'm winning
Wars they created just to understand
"The meaning of"

The meaningI'm just a victim of the weapon in my hand
So many casualties of love
But I've been bulletproof
I'm staring at the sun!

I was the one you took home
Never a flame to burn slow
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
So many bodies I've touched
Crashing around me like dust
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

I don't need nobody
Need nobody but
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you

I'm just so used to emptiness
Can't feel your heartbeat when I'm lying on your chest
You're different from the ones before
I know you don't believe it's you I've waited for

I was the one you took home
Never a flame to burn slow
But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
So many bodies I've touched
Crashing around me like dust
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

I don't need nobody
Need nobody but
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you

But I was hoping you'd see me a different way
You are the realest thing I've never had to fake

I don't need nobody
Need nobody but
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but you
I don't need nobody
Need nobody but youAnyway far from here
Wanting home tonight
Feeling the cold fear

I don't speak as you do
I don't even know who I am (Who am I?)
My hands are getting colder
Your temper's gettin' older

Where are you going to?
Are you trying to take off it?
My heart is always searching
But you're not climbing

Carry up to me (Escalante)
Hold the air I breathe (Escalante)
What you say you said? (Escalante)
A steep mountain
And your stones were stained with my poison
Escalante

The whole shit is coming back from me
A fingerprint decayed with hate
If you love me, you should show me
How to reconsider what I did

Take me again, again and again
To the place where there's no dark
I can't steal your sight again
But I can kill you in the dark

Carry up to me (Escalante)
Hold the air I breathe (Escalante)
What you say you said? (Escalante)
A steep mountain
And your stones were stained with my poison
Escalante

Carry up to me (Escalante)
Hold the air I breathe (Escalante)
What you say you said? (Escalante)
A steep mountain
And your stones were stained with my poison
Again and again
Carry up to me (know you know it)
Hold me, hold me (I'm feeling empty)
What do we have done (breaking the relief)
A steep mountain, and you know I love it
EscalanteAnd the cherry sky
Under blossom clouds
Though it's late July
You don't even try
Still you look so cool
Like a cover boy when you light the moon

Need the countryside
But I just forgot
All the things that matter
I forget a lot
I get so caught up
In the city crowd
But this place is still my first love

Is there anybody out there
Waiting for me on my way
If that somebody is you
Then baby I just want to say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

Guess I need to run
Take me to the bus
But don't let me go
No, don't let me on
Got to hold me tight
Won't put up a fight
Of course I'll stay
I'll stay the night

Is there anybody out there
Waiting for me on my way
If that somebody is you
Then baby I just want to say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

We're at the lost and found
We're at the lost and found

Is there anybody out there
Waiting for me on my way
If that somebody is you
Then baby I just want to say
Tonight, nothing will bring us down
Tonight, we're at the lost and found

We're at the lost and found
We're at the lost and foundShouldn't need a riddle to unlock your heart
So, say what's on your mind
We got other things that we could do with our
Time, we could rule the world
Know you say you never need another girl
But, you're not making sense
Trying to keep it moving while you're on the fence

Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes

It's a mystery
I know that something happened in your history
Oh, it's too much to risk
You give me some, but you've been holding most of it
Back, so it's no surprise
Everything you do, I over analyze
Breathe, in and out
Baby, give me something new to think about

Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes

Tell me black and white
Why I'm here tonight
I can't read the signs

Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codes
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can't do it no more
I need a love to celebrate
Stop talking in codes, stop talking in codes
Let me know what's up, can’t do it no more
So baby, take it all the way
Stop talking in codesWe've only ever touched
When there's no one else around
I can be elusive if you want me to
I'm not being intrusive
I just wish I knew the truth

As to why 
I wait for you
Longer than the average person would
And why
I think about you 
More than I think one should

Our body's fit together like a makeshift puzzle
And It's clear to see why you puzzle me
when you turn your frame
And you whisper my name
As though I am a burden

And I know
and I know
this will happen again and again
so don't let us pretend that this is the end
this is the end
this is the end

I am at your house
So I belong to you for now
Trying to impress you 
But lord I don't know how
I can be a statue if you want me to
I'm not being difficult I just need to know the truth

As to why
I'm wanting you
And I would take you away if I could
And why I'm still here
It's something I still haven't understood

Our hands press together like pieces of paper
But they're always blank when I hold your hand
And it gave you a fright
When I stayed the night
Cus you gave yourself to me

And I'm making up for last time
And I'm making up for you
And I'm waking up from last night
And I'm waking up with you
So what's new
So what's new
So what's new

Our hands press together like pieces of paper
But they're always blank when I hold your hand
And it gave you a fright
When I stayed the night
Cus you gave yourself to me

And I'm making up for last time
And I'm making up for you
And I'm waking up from last night
And I'm waking up with you
So what's new
So what's new
So what's new
So what's newEvery day it seems your life is up and down
And you say that you're looking for an answer
Everywhere you look it seems it can't be found

Like searching, trying to find the rainbow
No one's ever found it, yet it's told to be
But if you're looking for a lover
Everything you need, yeah, you can find right here with me

I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul

Now you've been trapped by love
Someone takes your heart and then says goodbye
So you say that you'll never love another
Tired of playing games and that's the reason why

But now whenever were together
There's a certain feeling that we both agree
And it's time that you've opened up to love
'Cause if you don't ever try, then baby, you may never see

I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul

Together you and I were meant to be
I'll be right beside you whenever you need me
This love you have will never fade away
You can count on me 'cause I'm here to stay

I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soulRunning through the woods, running through this shots
Tryna to survive a day!
All I want is that you extend your hand to me
Singing outside waiting for the words to come
Living my life tryna do what's right,
And hope for a better day
You know those words you wrote me brought me to my knees
All I'm saying is that

You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, to be alone
You're home, hope you find your way home

Singing outside waiting for the world to call
Living my life tryna do what's right
In the hope of a better day
And all I want is that you extend your hand to me
Oooh, I want show me where it hurts,
We'll make it OK
Tell me that you'll stay
Even when I'm far away
My voice will carry through
Until the end it's me & you
We can make it if we try
All that I'm saying is that

You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, you'll never be alone
You're home, to be alone
You're home, hope you find your way home

You're never gonna be aloneFeeling this way for you
There's something in the way you move
Something in the way you move
With you I'm never healing
It's heartache through and through
There's something in the way you move
Don't know what it is you do

Not one bone in your body good enough for me
But this heart is open, bloodstain on my sleeve
When our eyes meet I can only see the end
But tonight I'm here yours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what're you waiting for?

Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh

There's an evil night air
The stars don't shine tonight
Something in the way you do
Something in the way you

Push me closer, further
Break me just enough
Your lies always seem so true
There's nothing left for me to lose

There's not one thing I can do to change your ways
But I can't sit back and take the lonely days
When our eyes meet I can only see the end
And tonight the rain pours again

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what're you waiting for?

Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh

But tonight I'm gonna lose it all
Playing with fire, I was the first to fall
Heart is sinking like a cannonball
Baby, kill it, what're you waiting for?

Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
Oh
Something in the way you move
Something in the way you do it
Something in the way you move
OhBut you know what you are here for
Close your eyes
Lay yourself beside me
Hold tide for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone we don't need attention

Open your hand 
Take a glass
Don't be scared 
I'm right here
Even though you don't roll
Trust me boy 
You wanna be high for this

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh

Take it off
You want it off
Cause I know what you're feeling
It's ok
Boy I feel it too
Let it be 
Baby, breathe
I swear I'm right here
We'll be good
I promise we'll be so good

Oh, open your hand 
Take a glass
Don't be scared 
I'm right here
Even though you don't roll
Trust me boy 
You wanna be high for this

Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-ohIn the back of a car with you, I stare into the sun
Still not too old to die young
But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
Way, way, way, way
(And then you take it all away)
Way, way, way, way

Place a kiss on my cheekbone
Then you vanish me, I'm buried in the snow
But something tells me I'm not alone

But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
Way, way, way, way
(And then you take it all away)
Way, way, way, way

So lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything
So lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away

I chase your love around a figure eight
I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away
Way, way, way, way
(And then you take it all away)
Way, way, way, wayI think I know what you're trying to say
Honey, it's fair play
Why try to win when I know I've lost?
We don't have to spell it
I think I know what you're trying to say
Just because I think this could break me
It doesn't mean that it will at all

Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you, babe
Do what you have to

What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me

Let's call it a day, babe
I think I know what you're trying to say
And honey you're so right
There's so much to lose, but so much to learn
Let's call it a maybe
But we both know you're already gone
And just because it feels like I'm breaking
It doesn't mean I will fall apart

Love to the lovers
Hate to the haters
Love to you, babe
Do what you have to

What a shame
What a loss
The winner takes
She takes it all
What a shame
What a loss
But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for me

Love to you, babe
Love to the lovers

But I can see why
Because she's beautiful
What a defeat
To say the least
But thank God
The love is free
And maybe it's good for you
It's good for meChosen specially for you and I
Who will live inside

The mountaineers gathered tinder piled high 
In which to take along
Driving many miles, knowing they'd get here 

When they got here, all exhausted 
On the roof leaks they got started 
And now when the rain comes, we can be thankful 

Ooh, ah, ooh
When the mountaineers saw that everything fit
They were glad, and so they took off

Thought we were due
For a change or two
Around this place

When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay with 

The village used to be all one really needs 
Now it's filled with hundreds and hundreds of chemicals
That mostly surround you 
You wish to flee, but it's not like you 
So listen to me, listen to me 

Oh, oh, and when the morning comes
We will step outside 
We will not find another man in sight
We like the newness, the newness of all 
That has grown in our garden soaking for so long 

Whenever I was a child
I wondered what if my name had changed
Into something more productive like Roscoe 
Been born in 1891 
Waiting with my Aunt Rosaline 

Thought we were due
For a change or two 
Around this place

When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay with 

Oh

1891
They roamed around and foraged
They made their house from cedars
They made their house from stone

Oh, they're a little like you
And they're a little like me
We have all we need

Thought we were due
For a change or two 
Around this place 
This place, this place

When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay with
When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay withMakes my heartbeat like a drum
See the panic in my eyes
Kiss me, hold me when I cry
'Cause you always want what you're running from
And you know this is more than you can take

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh, your touch so bittersweet
Aahhh, ah aaha
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us

Your cheek is softly by the sun
Makes my heartbeat like a drum
I know it hurts you
I know it burns you
Hot and cold in a lonely hotel room
Look into me, tell me why you're crying
I need to know

'Cause you always want what you're running from
And it's always been that way
Oh

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh, your touch so bittersweet
Aahhh, ah aaha
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us

'Cause you always want what you're running from

Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks us
Baby please don't look away
When the morning breaks us
Oh, your touch so bittersweet
Aahhh, ah aaha
Baby don't forget my name
When the morning breaks usAnd I gave in
I lacked the things you need the most, you said
Where have you been?

You wasted all that sweetness to run and hide
I wonder why
I remind you of the days you poured your heart into
But you never tried

I've fallen from grace
Took a blow to my face
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost

Explosions
On the day you wake up needing somebody
And you've learned it's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same
It will never be the same

You left my soul bleeding in the dark
So you could be king, ah
The words you said are still untold to me
And I've lost my faith in everything

The nights you could cope, your intentions were gold
But the mountains will shake
I need to know I can still make...

Explosions
On the day you wake up needing somebody
And you've learned it's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same

And as the floods move in
And your body starts to sink
I was the last thing on your mind
I know you better than you think
'Cause it's simple, darling
I gave you a warning
Now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces
So watch them fall with you in slow-motion
I pray that you'll find peace of mind
And I'll find you another time

I'll love you another time

Explosions
On the day you wake up needing somebody
And you've learned it's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the sameLet it all fall out, open your mouth
Often I lie wide awake, think of things I can make
But I don't seem to have the parts to build them

Human, I wonder why you're a better make
Than I could ever build or create, you know not love or hate
I am so scared of what will kill me in the end
For I am not prepared, I hope I will get the chance

To be someone, to be human 
Look what we've done, look what we've done

I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)

Human, I'm trying to come clean, I will be a better me
I will not drink until I'm dead, I'll make the most of it
I don't know what it's like to be alive, to say goodbye
To cry a thousand times because my ears won't listen

Human, I'm trying not to lose my faith in you
I've sussed out all that I've seen through, I've sailed an ocean
I am so scared of what I'll look like in the end
For I am not prepared, I hope I will get the chance

To be someone, to be human
Look what we've done, look what we've done

I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)

I used to hear it all so loud, the sound of my heart breaking
The truth is waiting to be found, I trust that I will take it 

I would give my life
I would give my life (Human)
I would give my life (Human)
I would give my life (Human)

I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)
I would give my life to be (Human)Makes my body ache and I'm ready
To fall into the sky
I see now
The reason why

Yeah
Yeah

This feeling is heavy
Makes my body ache and I'm ready
To fall into the sky
I see now
The reason why
My heart is heavy
Takes me to a place I can't breathe
Only then I know why I see
The warning sign

This feeling is heavy
Makes my body ache and I'm ready
To fall into the sky
I see now
The reason why

This feeling is heavy
Makes my body ache and I'm ready
To fall into the sky
I see now
The reason why
My heart is heavy
Takes me to a place I can't breathe
Only then I know why I see
The warning signSooner or later I'll be on my own
June into summer, I'll wear out my shoes
Tune into someone, got nothing to lose

Without your love I'm getting somewhere

Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere
Without your love I'm getting somewhere

Move in the sun till I burn all my ties
Hay fever scratching and watery eyes
I think I've been waiting for this all my life
Coldest dark kisses left frozen in timeHit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning

Handle bars, and then I let go, let go for anyone
Take me in, and throw out my heart and get a new one
Next thing, we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes

So we burst into colors, colors and carousels
Fall head first, like paper planes and playground games
Next thing, we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes

Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching

Hit me with lightning

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goesKnow your bullets fly through the night
Broken doors falling, and hotel floors 
I was never yours, never mine

All I said was "Hello, hello"
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time
And all I said was "Hello, hello"
Tell me how to say "goodbye", cause it's goodbye

I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it die

See change whispers in the waves
Watch my sorrows drown peacefully
And empires crumble to the shores
I was never yours, never mine

All I said was "Hello, hello"
You just stood and watched me cry to pass the time
And all I said was "Hello, hello"
Tell me how to say "goodbye", cause it's goodbye

I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it die

I can't stay on my knees
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it die
I can't stay on my knees (on my knees)
Give me some mercy, please
It's alright
Let it die (it's alright)
I wanted everything
More than your love could give
It's alright
Let it dieWith a spinning head I lie and watch you smoke
Change the hands on my watch and hold you close
This misery is weightless as a stone

Have you lost the same things I have lost?
Do you know the panic I know?
And would I see the terror in your face?
Do you know that fever I know?
I wish time was still we'd stay right here
With time to kill in our hearts without chains
And if time was still we'd have no fear
Or scars to heal in our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chains

You left everything behind except yourself
And all I see is question marks and nothing else
You must've landed in New York by now
Please don't bring this love down

Have you lost the same things I have lost?
Do you know the panic I know?
And would I see the terror in your face?
Do you know that fever I know?
I wish time was still we'd stay right here
With time to kill in our hearts without chains
And if time was still we'd have no fear
Or scars to heal in our hearts without chains
In a house without chains

Don't bring this love down
Don't bring this love down
Don't bring this love down
Don't bring this love down

I wish time was still we'd stay right here
With time to kill in our hearts without chains
And if time was still we'd have no fear
Or scars to heal in our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chains
In our hearts without chainsPart of you, bittersweet
But now you tell me lies
Up and down, cold and hot
Swear to God, got to stop
Because I can't sleep at night
If you wanted love like this
Blowing up with every kiss
Should've known better

Because you find yourself alone
Chilling you right to the bone
No, should've known better

You and me just
Running towards the light
Giving up the fight
Hoping we survive

You and me just
Strangers in the night
Giving up the fight
Waiting to ignite

Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life

Lost in you, lost in me
Afraid of love, in too deep
So we just run and hide

Lightening fast, felt the crash
Scared to lose, fear attacks
We only know goodbye

You and me just
Running towards the light
Giving up the fight
Hoping we survive

You and me just
Strangers in the night
Giving up the fight
Waiting to ignite

Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life

If you wanted love like this
Blowing up with every kiss
Should've known better

Then you find yourself alone
Chilling you right to the bone
No, should've known better

Hopelessly holding on
To all those perfect nights
Let's pretend it's not gone
And say we'll never die

You and me just
Running towards the light
Giving up the fight
Hoping we survive

You and me just
Strangers in the night
Giving up the fight
Waiting to ignite

Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life
Holding on for life

Hopelessly holding on
To all those perfect nights
Let's pretend it's not gone
And say we'll never die
Say we'll never dieCover your eyes so you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath to see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year I knew the panic was over

Yes, since we found out
Since we found out

That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

After the war we said we'd fight together
I guess we thought that's just what humans do
Letting darkness grow
As if we need its palette and we need its colour

But now I've seen it through
And now I know the truth

Baby, I'll give you everything you need
I'll give you everything you need, oh
I'll give you everything you need
But I don't think I need you

Stripped to the waist
We fall into the river
Cover your eyes
So you don't know the secret
I've been trying to hide
We held our breath
To see our names are written
On the wreck of '86
That was the year
I knew the panic was over

Yet since we found out
Since we found out
That anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could happen
Anything could

I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
I know it's gonna be
Oh, whoa

But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need you
But I don't think I need youDo I get the best of your love
Even when our bodies are drunk
Is it me you're stumbling from
Forget the words that you said
With your fingers spell out my name
Take away the sky in our breath
Remember love is a game, love is a game

Don't break, don't fade
While we're not real, we're never too late
Make time, it won't hurt
Said I'll go now, but you said it first

I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste

In the midst I'm seeing your face
And I can't believe this is fake
Blow the blossom into your room
As you throw me in disarray
There's a button that I need to press
There's a face that I need to kiss
Come on, give me your heart and your head
Make you conscious never resist, never resist

Don't break, don't fade
While we're not real, we're never too late
Make time, it won't hurt
Said I'll go now, but you said it first

I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste

I know there's nothing that I can do to make you stay
But one thing I know that will always remain
And that's the aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertaste
The aftertasteWe hold our heads up high tonight
And we breathe the smoke ethereal
We let our hearts subside tonight

But it marks the skin 'cause I know I've sinned
And it plagues the air on my house movin'
There's a sound out here in the darkest woods
And I know my own fears are understood

It's a ritual and I know you feel it
It's a ritual and I know you've seen it
It's a ritual and I know you feel it
You feel it, you feel it, you feel it

We jump into the devil's shoes
It's far too late to be rescued
From high we see some thundered skies
We see our faith, you hear our cries, it comes

And it won't stop here, echo in my ear
There's a raging fire and it burns so near
But I'm ready now, but I'm ready now

The ritual, we lose it allRunning from the truth because the truth's too much to take
I keep raising glasses because I only got today
I just keep moving, I just keep moving

You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
Happy, in rain or thunder
Baby I keep
I keep on, I keep on, I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing

Can you see my, see my headlights
You can come ride shotgun with me
Whatever you like, ever you like
Every time I look at those stars
Know they ain't got the answers for me
But I'll be alright, I'll be alright

You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
Happy, in rain or thunder
Baby I keep
I keep on, I keep on, I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing
I just keep on dancing

I just keep on dancing
(Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing)

You can hurt me, I'll find another
You can love me, you'll be my lover
I just keep on dancing
(Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing)
I just keep on dancing
(Keep on dancing
Keep on dancing)
I just keep on dancingAnd you were someone else
I'd say so much to you
And I would tell the truth

'Cause I can hardly breathe
When your hands let go of me
The ice is thinning out
And my feat brace themselves

I'm there in the water
Still looking for ya
I'm there in the water
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

You've seen this all before
Life left on the shore
We're smiling all the same
You sail away again

Oh, yeah
I'm dead in the water (I'm dead in the water)
Still looking for ya (Still looking for ya)
I'm dead in the water (I'm dead in the water)
Can't you see? (Can't you see?)
Can't you see?I would’ve listened to my brother when he spoke to me
And I never would’ve played with my conscience
In the fields where I was in their company

But you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I used them on my youth
And you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, and I won’t lose them

Now I found my feet
Count to one, two, three
And I’m taking off tonight, now I’m free
As I walk my feet on the cold concrete
And I, and I, and I

I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city, eh eh eh

I wandered down the streets with my new town
With the lights blinding and my heart weighed down
I think I'll get a job receiving people's thunder
For the folks back home, I will make them proud

But you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I used them on my youth
Yeah, you gave me wings and I used them
I used them, I don't wanna lose them
I don't wanna lose them

I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city, eh eh eh

Shoulders ache for want of wings
My city shakes the fear in me

I can feel my dreams when I’m in my city, eh eh eh
I fall on my knees for my, for my city, eh
We go on every dream in my, in my city, eh eh eh
And that’s where I’ll stay
And that’s where I’ll stay
In my city, eh eh ehTake another sip
(Don't panic)
Stop checking your phone
Looking for the answers
(Don't panic)
Mind running obsessed
Feeling paralyzed
(Don't panic)
Let me watch you undress
Fall into the night

Yeah we change and we change and we feel so lost
And we don't know who we are
Yeah we break and we break and we just can't stop,
So we just keep breaking hearts

Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can we take it back to the start?
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic

Been shattered before
Everything breaks
(Don't)
I can't really be sure
Of our mistakes
(Don't panic)
Come under my love
Like an umbrella
(Don't panic)
Going to make you feel good
Yeah, better than ever

Yeah we change and we change and we feel so lost
And we don't know who we are
Yeah we break and we break and we just can't stop
So we just keep breaking hearts

Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can we take it back to the start
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic

I got big dreams, baby
I got big dreams, baby
So don't you overcomplicate it
I got big dreams, baby
I got big dreams, baby
So don't you, don't you overcomplicate it

Why you wanna ruin a good thing
Can we take it back to the start
When love's not playing out like the movies
It doesn't mean it's falling apart
Don't panic
Don't panic
Don't panic
Don't panicWho are we to play with hearts and throw away it all?
Who are we to turn each others heads?
Who are we to find ourselves in other people’s beds?

I don't like the way I never listen to myself
I feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help
Oh, I don't think you want me much at all

This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
I'm feeling down about this love

Who are you to make me feel so good?
Who are we to tell ourselves that we're misunderstood?
Who am I to say I'm always yours?
Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores?

I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart
Now we're falling on each other like we're always in the dark
Oh, I don't think you know me much at all, all, all, at all

This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall

This love is not what you want
This heart will never be yours
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfallI do what I love and I love what I do

How many times do I need to
Need to fight you baby
Just to get that it's no good

And I know that I'm strong
But my mind's almost gone
And it's getting on my mood
And all this buzzing you been doing
See you got me hanging up
See you really got me worse

But I got to move on baby
Because bitches got to eat
Got to get back to work

How many hits do you need for
Me to get it in you

And I'm strong and my heart
In my heart it won't change
For anyone or anything

Because your lover is a dick
This will get you over it

I do what I love and I love what I doWe've got a life that hasn't even began
Something's calling us
We're breaking free
I'm curious I need to see
Like a flash before our eyes we'll leap toward the night
And if it feels like we're dreaming
Believe it, believe it (Yeah)

We don't have to wait till the morning
The sun will never go down (Yeah)
What we'll do it wait forever
We gotta take it now (Yeah)
So stay awake, stay awake
You can stay with us till paradise
So stay awake, stay awake

Hand in hand side by side
While our reflections flicker bodies collide
So full of energy nothing to hide
No need to sleep we come alive
And if we're gonna take this ride we can go wherever we like
And if it feels like we're dreaming
Believe it, believe it (Yeah)

We don't have to wait till the morning
The sun will never go down (Yeah)
What we'll do it wait forever
We gotta take it now (Yeah)
So stay awake, stay awake
You can stay with us till paradise
So stay awake, stay awake

Take my fate in your hands 
We've got a life that hasn't even began
Something's calling us

Like a flash before our eyes we'll leap toward the night
And if it feels like we're dreaming

So stay awake, stay awake
You can stay with us till paradise
So stay awake, stay awakeI'll take you to the ocean, I'll bring the sun
We are 17, we have just begun
I have loved to fight for and then some
You are the one, the one, the one, the one
The one, the one, the one, the one

Wake up in the morning, we're paralyzed
We'll fly into the garden like butterflies
There will be no blood and there'll be no pain
I want to fall in love with you again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal, an animal, an animal

I'll tie you in my arms, I will smother you
We'll tell each other lies, I will tell the truth
I'll colour in the sky, and I'll colour you
I want to join your skin again, again, again, again
Again, again, again, again

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal, an animal

We will run away from danger
We will run away
I-I-I-I-I, I will have to fight for...

You have stolen all my senses
There's a fever in my heart
And you are taking my defenses
You are pulling me apart
Forever we are and we are dying
And we will be standing on our ground
So I will take away my feeling
I will be an animal, an animalLike a last breath you would breathe
You were like home to me
I don't recognize this street

Please don't close your eyes
Don't know where to look without them
Outside the cars speed by
I've never heard them until now

I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it
You were just saving yourself when you hide it

Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin
And I know you care

I used to run down the stairs
To the door and I thought you were there
To shape to the comfort of us
Two lovers locked out of love

Oh, but I know you care
I know it is always been there
But there is trouble ahead, I can feel it
You were just saving yourself when you hide it

Yeah, I know you care
I see it in the way you stare
As if there was trouble ahead and you knew it
I'll be saving myself from the ruin

I know it wasn't always wrong
But I've never known a winter so cold
Now I don't warm my hands in your coat
But I still hope
'Cause this is how things ought to have been

And I know the worst of it
Wasn't all that it seemed
Why can't I dream, why can't I dream?
'Cause I know you care

And I know you care
I know you care, I know you care
I know it's always been thereMm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm, mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

Only you can be
The aching in my heart, my enemy
The only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive

Only you

Only you can see 
The emptiness I feel when you're with me

The aching in my heart, my enemy
The only animal I couldn't fight
You hold me in the dark when storms arrive

Only youI look in the mirror

I can't get over you
Is it someone?
Is it someone else?
Is it someone else?

I look in the mirror
And I try to see myself
My head full of terror
From the games I played so well
I try to see clearer
I try to forget the fires I started
I try to be nearer
To where you are
To where you are

Are we star crossed lovers?
Did I really want you gone?
If I'm really a winner
Where did these demons come from?

I was the girl who was on fire
I was the girl who was on fire
Only a bird could get much higher
(I look in the mirror)
'Cause I was the girl who was on fire

I look in the mirror
And I try to understand
And piece it together
Watch the blood from both my hands
I can't see the ending
There are people who know my every secret
I'm tired of pretending
You're in my heart
In my heart

Are we star crossed lovers?
Did I really want you gone?
If I'm really a winner
Where did these demons come from?

I was the girl who was on fire
I was the girl who was on fire
Only a bird could get much higher
(I look in the mirror)
'Cause I was the girl who was on fireI don't even really know what you intended
Thought that you were cute and you could make me jealous
Poured it down, so I poured it down

Next I thing that I know, I'm in a hotel with you
You were talking deep, like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind

Now I always hear always hear them talking
Talking about a girl, about a girl with my name
Saying that I hurt you, but I don't still don't get it
You didn't love me, no not really

Wait, I could've really liked you
I bet, I bet that's why I keep on thinking about you
It's a shame, you said I was good
So I poured it down, so I poured it down

And now I don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And I know I shouldn't say it
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind

You got yourself in a dangerous zone
Because we both had the fear, fear of being alone
And I still don't understand it
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
And my heart don't understand it
Understand it, understand it
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
But my heart don't understand
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebody
You think you know somebody
Why I got you on my mind
You think you know somebodyThat true love, it was taken away from us so young
We're summer kids
Without a song, we're fading in to oblivion
But we're still the one

We got our guard up and we're hung up on another loss
I need to summon all these demons keeping me on the floor
But now we're here and I am giving everything to you
Just say you need this, say you need me, say you want this too

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we do

That sadness kills

Don't let the past dictate the way you play it now
Don't play it down
The time is now
I know you're feeling what I feel, just let it show
Don't let it go

Somebody somewhere driving in their car is crying out
Forever running from the truth, sometimes all we have is doubt
But now we're here and I am giving all I can to you
Just say you love me, say you love me, say you want this too

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we do

No one does it like we do
No one does it like we do

Somebody somewhere driving in their car is crying out
Forever running from the truth, sometimes all we have is doubt
But now we're here and I am giving all I can to you
Just say you love me, say you love me, say you want this too

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we do

Say you want this too
Say you need this too
We're the greatest
No one gets it like we do
Gets it like we do
Kills it like we do
We're the greatest
No one does it like we doI feel a lump in my throat
And this is far from joy

I never seem to learn
That high makes things harder
That high I get from you

I've figured out the joy is not in your arms
I know I'll always ache with an empty heart
I think it's time to run 'cause I'm seeing stars
I'm seeing stars watch me fall apart

I think of dying all the time
But I've got joy to take my side
Fear is my favourite

Oh, and then you'll seeI'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene

And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
Hes the only one for me, Jolene

I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
JoleneWhen everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight

I need your love
I need your love

I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart

I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight

I need your love
I need your love

Now I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?
I walk in circles but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong
I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong

And I feel so helpless here
Watch my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight

I need your love
I need your love

All the years, all the times
You have never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing

And all the tears, all the lies
All the waste
I've been trying to make it change
And now my eyes are open

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be freeWhy when men look outside do they see houses,
Instead of the fields they grew from?
We are constantly uprooted from them, making us tiresome and fearful
Can you get up right now, endeavor to free-fall

'Cause you can fall if you want to 
It's just a matter of how far
You treasured our home town
But you've forgotten where you are
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found
And it has been found wandering around

With that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away
And I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed

Patterns all arranged in my background
These pillars and posts keeping this country on form
Letters were all sent with no addresses
So that people can't discover
We're always undercover
Why do I always draw triangles
Instead of words this paper so deserves?

'Cause you see
I don't own my clothes but I own my mind
And it's not what you've lost
But it's what you find.

You found that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away
And I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed

'Cause you can fall if you want to
It's just a matter of how far
You've treasured our home town
But you've forgotten where you are
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found
And it has been found wandering around

With that skipping rope, the trampoline
The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away
And I wish I stayed
I wish I stayed
I wish I stayedLike all the boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before,
Like all the boys, boys, boys

You left a blood stain on the floor
You set your sights on him
You left a hand print on the door
Like all the boys before,
Like all the boys before

This is our luck baby, running out
Our clothes were never off
We still have our roads to run about
To scale the map, scale the map,
To get us back on track

I've seen you in a fight you lost,
I've seen you in a fight

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
Your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me

Like all the boys before

In here the world won't bring us down
Our plan is gold dust
Out there a lonely girl could drown
In here we're frozen

Where did the people go?
My hands are empty
You're not the answer I should know
Like all the boys before, like all the boys
Before

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
Your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me

We're in a mess baby,
We're in a mess babe
Your more is less babe
We're in a mess baby,
We're in a mess babe
Your more is less babe

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
And your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
(I've seen you in a fight you lost)
Like all the boys before,
Like all the boys before

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
Our house full of paper,
And your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing me

We're under the sheets
And you're killing me
In our house made of paper,
Your words all over me
We're under the sheets
And you're killing meYou're living in the past it's a new generation
A girl can do what she wants to do and that's
What I'm gonna do
An' I don't give a damn ' bout my bad reputation

Oh no not me

'Bout my bad reputation

Oh no, not me
Oh no, not
Not me, not meWasn't any war we couldn't win
We had unbreakable powers
When our bodies meet, it's everything
This was a beautiful vision
Even love was not a way you could describe it
And then there comes a collision
Nothing ever goes in the night

And they're not lost forever
Lost what once was here
It's now just sparks
Now the fireworks are fading
Is it over?
Lost you in the summer 

Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago

If there's no storm, why're we a shipwreck?
Thought our love is insurmountable
He knows my heart is still aching
Never thought it would be caused by you

We're not lost forever
Lost what once was here
It's now just  sparks
Now the fireworks are fading
Is it over?
Lost you in the summer 

Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
You, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Two years ago
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on

And the reason I can't forget is I think you do too
I know you think of me, too
I'll use this moment to really forget
I will soon, but for now
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you

Two years ago
About you
About you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
About you
About you
I'm still thinking 'bout you, you, you
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Two years ago
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving on
Two years ago
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
There's a part of me that still believes that we belong
I'm wide awake and I can feel us moving on
Moving on, moving on, moving onSwore upon the sun I'd save you for a rainy day
Loosen the noose then let go of the rope
I know if it's never coming back, it has to go

I keep calling your name (Keep calling your name)
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed
So I keep calling at night (Keep calling at night)
I wanna hold you close, I just never wanna hold you tight

Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms

I've found the weakness and put it to play
Swore upon the stars I'd keep you till the night was day
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know
You said if you're never coming back you have to go

I keep calling your name (Keep calling your name)
I wanna hold you close but I never wanna feel ashamed
So I keep calling at night (Keep calling at night)
I wanna hold you close, I just never wanna hold you tight

Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop
Calling it off
Calling it off just to keep crawling to your arms

Oh my goodness, here I go again
Pulling you back to me
Pulling you back into my arms so selfishly
I don't think I understand, 'cause I don't really know myself
I keep calling you up, calling you up
Calling you up
Calling you up
Calling you up
(So, I can call)Years of too much thought and time I wasted
And in each line upon my face
Is proof I fought and lived another day

When did life become this place of madness?
Drifting on an empty sea of waves and sadness?
I make believe I'm in control
And dream it wasn't all my fault

When your feet don't touch the ground
When your voice won't make a sound
Here, it's safe
In this place
Up off the clouds
When your feet don't touch the earth
You can't feel the fates that hurt
And you're free
There's no need 
To come down
When your feet don't touch the ground

Everyday just feels a little longer
Why am I the only one not getting stronger?
Running around pretending life's a play
It doesn't make the darkness go away

I may be young but I can still remember
Feeling full of joy, crying tears of laughter
Now all my tears are all cried out
Make-believe, but count me out

'Cause my feet are on the ground
And the inner voice I found
Tells the truth, "There's no use,
if your head's in the clouds"
With my feet on solid earth
I can face the fates that hurt
And in time
I'll be fine
I'll come 'round

I was once like you
Life was a maze
I couldn't find my way out
But what I say is true
You will be amazed
Make-believe and you will find out that it's true

When your feet don't touch the ground
When your voice won't make a sound
Here, it's safe
In this place
Up off the clouds
When your feet don't touch the earth
You can't feel the fates that hurt
And you're free
There's no need 
To come down
When your feet don't touch the groundI had a heart then, but the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping up the strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone



Noises, I play within my head
Touch my own skin and hope that I'm still breathing
And I think back to when my brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place the only time I feel safe

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone





You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone

'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone
You shine them when I'm alone

Home, home


Home, home


Home, home


Home, homeYou know we can get away
Because I'm calling your name
Every day I feel this pain
But you just turn and walk away

No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong
With you and me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Touch me and then turn away
And put your hands into the flame
Tell me if you feel this pain
'Cause I don't wanna be a ball and chain

No, I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me
I just don't know what is wrong






Yeah, give me the respect
Forgive me and forget
I've gotta get a grip
Living on the edge

I barely even know this fuckin' woman in my bed
And if there's too much on my plate, then I ain't finishing my veg
And if anybody said the grass is greener on the other side
Well it ain't, swear on my mother's life
You got me wrapped up in your shit, I'm feeling mummified
I've only had this fuckin' feeling in my stomach twice


(To you and)


You gave me what I needed
And I gave her everything she wanted
There's something about your cleavage
Now I can't put my fingers on it
You're taking me the deepest
I thought she was gonna vomit
If all women from Venus
Then I guess I really got a rocket

You've got a noose around my neck but I'm still hanging on
We've nearly reached the finish line up in our marathon
I spat a verse, she sang a song
She broke my heart I took some Gaviscon


I just can't keep hanging on
To you and me, with you and me, with you andYou're the color of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me through the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

So love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've gotta find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire

Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Yeah yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?

Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Like you do)
Love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (Yeah)
Touch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do (Ah)
What are you waiting for?And I walked a thousand miles to prove it
And I'm caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts
The colour of my blood is all I see on the rocks
As you sail from me

Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me
My bones will bleach, my flesh will flee
So, help my lifeless frame to breathe

And God knows I'm not dying but I breathe now
And God knows it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew

The lost dreams I buried in my sleep for him
And this was the ecstasy of love forgotten
And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets
And my blood is all I see
As you steal my soul from me

Alarms will ring for eternity
The waves will break every chain on me

And God knows I'm not dying but I breathe now
And God knows it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew

And God knows I'm not dying but I breathe now
And God knows it's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you
It drowns the love I thought I knew

And God knows I'm not dying but I breathe now
And God knows It's the only way to heal now
With all the blood I lost with you (I lost with you, I lost with you)
It drowns the love I thought I knew (I thought I knew, I thought I knew)You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything

For what it's worth
For what it's worth
For what it's worth
You were my backbone when my body ached with weariness
You were my hold down when my heart was filled with loneliness
And just as the dark was rising I heard you close the door again
And just as the light turned south I knew who I dream of

Could've given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything

You are my only hope
The truth, the dare, the consequence
I know you don't feel the same you're sensible and it doesn't make sense
I know I'm gonna wait my heart out you know I'm gonna try much harder
But it isn't the shit in my head that's holding me under this time

Could've given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything
You my everything
You my everything

You my everything
You my everything
You my everything

You my everything
You my everything
You my everything

Could've given me something
You my everything
You left me kneeling
I'm just one of those people
You my everything
You my everything
You my everythingI was just lonely
I was just in need of a friend
Spend your days
Thinking if only
Thinking if only you and me made sense

For any love
Quit the pain you feel
You won't let it go
You won't let it heal
Baby, it's clear
You don't know me
You don't know me

And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough, I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal

It's in your eyes
I can see that you're broken
I know you're lost because I am too
It's in your voice
I hear you choking
When did the illusion take the truth

I think you're in love
With the pain you feel
You won't let it go
You won't let it heal
Baby, it's clear
You don't even know me
You don't even know me

And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal

You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out
It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love you've given now
You lit the fire and you held it in your hands until it flickered out
It wasn't innocent, you've measured every inch of love you've given now

And I don't have the heart that you think I do
And you give me so much, it's too much to lose
You know I'm not the one
Baby, I'm not the one
I can't show you my love that you showed to me
When it isn't enough I won't make-believe
You know I'm not the one
Baby, leave love alone
Let it heal
Let it heal
Heal
HealWith wounded lips and salted cheeks
And finally we step to leave
To the departure lounge of disbelief
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
And I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine bitter sunlight

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

Before daylight

In the canyon underneath the trees
Behind the dark sky, you looked at me
I fell for you like autumn leaves
Never faded, evergreen
And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
'Cause I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine bitter sunlight

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

I can't face this, now everything has changed
I just wanna be by your side
Here's hoping we collide, here's hoping we collide
Here's hoping we collide

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

I wanna hear your beating heart tonightYou never let me give up
All the nights and the fights
And the blood and the breakups
You're always there to call up
I'm a pain, I'm a child, I'm afraid
And yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
I know that we don't look like much
But no one fucks it up like us

16 and you never even judged me
Matter of fact I always thought you were too cool for me
Sitting there in the caravan
All the nights we've been drunk on the floor
And yeah you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

Dark times, you could always find the bright side
I'm amazed by the things that you would sacrifice
Just to be there for me
How you cringe when you sing out of tune
And yeah it's everything
So don't change a thing
We both know what they say about us
But they don't stand a chance because

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
Standing with an army

Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
(I'll be yours)
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
I'm standing with an army

Yet you understand
Yeah like no one can
We both know what they say about us

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
I'm standing with an army
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
I'm standing with an army
They don't have a chance either

Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing near you
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
Standing with an army
When I'm with you
Standing with an armyWhen I watched you disappear
When you made me stop believing
I could fight away the fear

Now the smoke has cleared and the end is near, it was my illusion
Like a broken dream, I was incomplete
But your love was never the missing piece

I feel like I'm breathing again
I feel like I'm seeing again
I feel like I'm breathing again
I got it under control-ol-ol
I got it under control-ol-ol
I got it under control-ol-ol

All that's real is faded
Like a car into the night
Like a painkiller, I take it
And I watch the world igniteThese haters couldn't get to where I am with a full tank of petrol, uh
My uncle used to drink a can of kestrel when life got stressful, uh
What kinda person should you be when wanna make people accept you, uh
What does it really mean when you dream of being famous and successful,
When you were born to be special,
Uh yeh and I went from the kid in class,
Text some radio DJs so they could bring me up
To the young rapper that everybody's ringing up,
Got em looking for a sprinkle of that pixie dust
Mad thoughts in my head when its blowin up
Like, are you really big enough?
I traded friends for fans
Cement for sand
Raise your hand 
The wonderman

[Ellie Goulding]
See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the wonderman)
I saw the chosen one their calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The wonderman

[Tinie Tempah]
Bored of being nameless
Bored of feeling awkward
When you walk up in the mall and cant afford a pair of trainers,
Imagine when it changes, imagine satisfaction when you make it,
Its more than being famous,
More then the applause and more than any form of status,
More than the performances in 20 foreign places,
Benidorm, Vegas, many more praises,
Amen hallelujah "Tinie look what's happened to ya?"
Yeh they love that attitude brand new and improved, yeh

And when the fans start grabbing you,
Show gratitude with a little brag or two,
Amen, hallelujah Tinie look what's happened to ya,
Who can say they ran all the obstacles I ran, look
I traded friends for fans, 
Cement for sand, 
Raise your hand, 
The wonderman

[Ellie Goulding - Chorus]
See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the wonderman)
I saw the chosen one their calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The wonderman

Come on come on the stars are where you belong
Come on come on follow your heart is gunna take you home
Come on come on the stars are where you belong
There's no turning back from here

See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the wonderman)
I saw the chosen one their calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, The wondermanLie next to your frame, girl unobserved
You change your position and you're changing me
Casting these shadows where they shouldn't be

We're interrupted by the heat of the sun
Trying to prevent what's already begun
You're just a body, I can smell your skin
And when I feel it, you're wearing thin

But I've got a plan

Why don't you be the artist
And make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer
And decide the words I say?

Because I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it’s too hard to ask
Won't you try to help me?

Sat on your sofa, it's all broken springs
This isn't the place for those violin strings
I try out a smile and I aim it at you
You must have missed it, you always do

But I've got a plan

Why don't you be the artist
And make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer
And decide the words I say?

Because I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it’s too hard to ask
Won't you try to help me?

You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted
You wait, I wait, casting shadows, interrupted
You wait, I wait, casting shadows

Why don't you be the artist
And make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer
And decide the words I say?

Because I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it’s too hard to ask
Won't you try to help me?

Why don't you be the artist
And make me out of clay?
Why don't you be the writer
And decide the words I say?

Because I'd rather pretend
I'll still be there at the end
Only it’s too hard to ask
Won't you try to help me?A silent heart ticking under the ground
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found
If you hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after all

A silent heart ticking under the ground
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found
If you hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after all

A silent heart ticking under the ground
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found
If you hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after all

A silent heart ticking under the ground
Taking the weight from which has yet to be found
If you hear me now, why don't you recall?
I was the one who cared after allIt starts with a picture and it sits in your frame
And we part with a letter and it ends in my name
And it starts with forever and it ends with a touch
And I know that you're clever and I don't ask for much



Maybe we forgot all the things we are
When we are together



You said I'm arresting, you said I had heat
I really thought that we'd go further the second time we meet
'Cause I'm tired of trying to keep you - all I want to do is sleep
And perhaps when I'm sleeping you'll get back on your feet



Maybe we forgot all the thing we are
When we are together

Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest
It's not so hard every time you go





I run out to meet you when I knew the storm had come
And I felt the rain on your face and the damage you had done
I know what you're thinking - it will never be the end
And when the storm is over, you won't see me again



Didn't know the price I'd paid for all the times I stayed
When we were together

Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest
It's not so hard

()
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
()
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
()
Maybe we forget, are we awake or not?
Or maybe we forgot

Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest

Wake me up, wake me up
Stop my fall every time you go
Tape me up then break me up
Ever so gently when I'm at my weakest
It's not so hard every time you goI need a helping hand, just to beat the void
I need a mission, a dream to stop me talking to myself
And now the silence is broken, now my soul is to sell
I need to pick up the pieces, to scatter to the wind
Hold the city to your ears, you can hear the waves come in

You can't change the world with a song
And you can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me
Wherever I go, it's playing for you
I can't stop this voice unravelling 'round of me
Whatever I do, it's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart
Beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me, believe, believe, believe me

Don't let it slip through your fingertips
When there's a ghost, don't try to reason with it
'Cause now I'm tired, I'm wired, so I won't miss a thing
I wrote my words up to dry, and I've forgotten what to sing

But you can't change the world with a song
You can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me
Wherever I go, it's playing for you
I can't stop this voice unravelling 'round of me
Whatever I do, it's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart
Beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me, believe, believe, believe me

If that's what it was to you
Then that's what it was to me
If that's what it was to you
Then that's what it was to me
If that's what it was to you
Then that's what it was to me

But you can't change the world with a song
You can't make it right when it's wrong

I can't stop this music traveling round with me
Wherever I go, it's playing for you
I can't stop this voice unravelling 'round of me
Whatever I do, it's talking to you
The world dances to the rhythm of its own heart
Beating for you, however you lose
So speak to me

Believe, believe, believe me
Believe, believe, believe meIf you never said anything?
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never said anything?

If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never
If you never, if you never

Here it is in my hands
In my veins and over lands
It spreads like fire, seeking air
To pull me in my own fanfare

Won't you come, won't you come
Won't you come, just don't say a word
Won't you come, won't you come
Won't you come, just don't say a word

If you never, if you never
Just don't say a word
If you never, if you never
Just don't say a word

I'm more alive than I've ever been
So, now I give you all my sins
Chosen you, I've chosen you
But don't say a word

And if I save us and I fall down
I will leave your words behind now
If you never held me under
If you never hear my thunderThis love is like fire and ice
This love is like rain and blue skies
This love is like sun on the rise
This love got me rolling the dice
Don't let me lose
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

Beautiful mind
Your heart got a story with mine
Your heart got me hurting at times
Your heart gave me new kind of highs
Your heart got me feeling so fine
So what to do
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

It took us a while
With every breath a new day
With love on the line
We've had our share of mistakes
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for you

Brighter than gold
This love shining brighter than gold
This love is like letters in bold
This love is like out of control
This love is never growing old
You make it new
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

It took us a while
Because we were young and unsure
With love on the line
What if we both would need more
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for you

Falling, crash into my arms
Love you like this
Like a first kiss
Never let go
Falling, crash into my arms
Never breaking what we got
Still falling for you
Still falling for...

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
All for me

And just like that
All I feel is you
All I feel is you
You are all for me
I'm still falling...
And just like that
All I feel is you
All I feel is you
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for youBite chunks out of me
You're a shark and I'm swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed
Now your friends come sniffing

Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go, my love, it's very late
Till morning comes, let's tessellate

Go alone my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones alone, my lover
And keep us on my heart

Three guns and one goes off
One's empty, one's not quick enough
One burn, one red, one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins

Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning, they'll nosh you up
Yes, they'll nosh the love away, but it's fair to say
You will still haunt me

Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe, back to back, let's go, my love, it's very late
Till morning comes

Wild green stones alone my lover
Keep us on my heartWhen you played the thief and I played the fool
Gonna make you move, make you move, make you move
Been so long crying over you
Now I'm coming your way
Gonna make you move, gonna make you move, make you move, make you move

Chasing faces in the sand
Now your dagger is in my hand
I'll make you move, I'll make you move, I'll make you move

I'll make you run faster, faster, faster
Flashlight
Flashlight
Get out of my way, get out of my way 'cause I can't lose
I'll make you run faster, faster, faster

Get out of my way, get out of my way

I'll make you run fa-, I'll make you run fa-
I'll make you run fa-, I'll make you run fa-

Coming down on you with a flashing light
There's nowhere to run maybe you can't hide
Gonna make you move, make you move, make you move

It's too late now the tables turned
There's no going back and you'll never learn
Unless I make you move, I make you move, I make you move

And you think I'm still broken hearted
But you'll never win the war you started
You'd better open your eyes

Faster , faster, faster

Fears overplayed
Two left feet emergency. 

Wide open space 
Catch my tail, 
fishing net. 
Fold up my frown 
take the rage 
and smooth it out. 

Stick to my skin, 
paper mache face to live in. 
Same view to paint, 
Watercolour your name 

Face your mistakes 
(You will never have to feel that way again) 
Oil your chains, under rate. 
(You will never have to feel that way again)

Press the dents, fighter plane 

I held the fort, and I swung my sword I have muted the screams I have broken the falls oh I have fought, and I swung my sword I have muted the screams I have broken the falls 

Fighter Plane 
Fly away!Show the bruises on your skin
Let the fires all burn out
I can hear the silent shout in you

Let it go don't be so scared
Find the love you lost again
Let the chaos disappear
Don't you know I'm always here for you

Cause this is devotion
I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion
I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
Cause this is devotion

Tell me what you dream about
I lose you in my sleep, somehow
Let the chaos disappear
Don't you know I'm always there for you

Cause this is devotion
I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion
I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
Cause this is devotion

Cause this is devotion
I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion
I am caught
Floating in your gravity

Cause this is devotion
I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion
I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
Cause this is devotionBecause over pain love is outgrown
I've never won a fight to understand
I just move as my heart commands

I've always had a thing for silence
But lately I just need a voice I recognise
Baby, it's perfect timing now to

Scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
So scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down

Have you found peace with your mistakes
Breathing on the glass as it breaks?
Have you found the words to save her
And keep your heart out of danger?

I don't think I can take the violence
And lately I just need a voice I recognise
Baby, it's perfect timing now to

Scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
So scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down

I've always had a thing for silence
But lately I just need a voice I recognise
Baby, it's perfect timing now to

Scream it out, out
I won't let you down, down
So scream it out, out
I won't let you down, downI'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
See I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world

If I was a sculptor, but then again no
Or a girl who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the worldFeels unused
I've never met anyone like you

Frightening
Feeling naked
Sensing, searching something sacred

I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll look for you, baby

Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

Go
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

I'm exhausted with loving
No fight in me, I'm defeated
I know I'm fooled, I can't help it
You make my heart so helpless

I'll forget you not
I'll forget you not
I'll look for you
For you, maybeYou drove me off the road

But you let go 'cause your hope is gone
And every question fades away

It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time to hear you heart's false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
Well, you know this is your biggest mistake

You tread water
Fighting for the air in your lungs
Move, move closer
Maybe you can right all your wrongs

But you let go 'cause your hope is gone
And every answer fades away

It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time to hear your heart's false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
Well, you know this is your biggest mistake

Wipe the mud stains from the face, stop the engine
Yeah, stop pretending
Wipe the mud spray from your face, stop the engine
Yeah, stop pretending that you're still breathing

It's a shame you don't know what you're running from
Would your bones have to break and your lights turn off
Would it take the end of time to hear your heart's false start?

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
Well, you know this is your biggest mistake

You know this is your biggest mistake
What a waste, what a waste, what a waste
And of all the things you never explained
You know this is your biggest mistakeAs long as stars are above you
And longer if I can

How long will I need you?
As long as the seasons need to
Follow their plan

How long will I be with you?
As long as the sea is bound to
Wash up on the sand

How long will I want you?
As long as you want me to
And longer by far

How long will I hold you?
As long as your father told you
As long as you can

How long will I give to you?
As long as I live through you
However long you say

How long will I love you?
As long as stars are above you
And longer if I may

How long will I love you?
As long as stars are above youTread floors you don't fall through 
Make waves, you crash a cymbal hard 
Follow no one, always play the wrong card
 
Waste days, in foreign places 
Shed light, on your better side 
Reassure me that you'll wait for me
Wait for me as long as it takes 

And I'll hold my breath, I'll hold my breath 

Until you see me in your dreams 
We'll stay awake beneath the trees 
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust 
A sky of diamonds just for us
You are the risk I'll always take 
The only branch I'll never break 
Those fears, we'll blow them all way 
We'll blow them all away 

Fight fires in your best clothes 
Touch skin with your eyes closed 
Chase thunder, with the volume down 
Pack a suitcase, wander to the next town 

Force quit, on your losing streak 
Solve a riddle in a magazine, be tongue in cheek 
Tell me that we're still too young
That we're still too young and I'll hold my tongue 

Until you see me in your dreams 
We'll stay awake beneath the trees 
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust 
A sky of diamonds just for us 
You are the risk I'll always take 
The only branch I'll never break 
Those fears, we'll blow them all way 
We'll blow them all away 

I'm here, I'm here to take you 
I'll swim, I will swim to save you 
No fall, I'm here to catch you 
I'll swim, I will swim to save you 

Until you see me in your dreams 
We'll stay awake beneath the trees 
We'll watch the buildings turn to dust 
A sky of diamonds just for us 
You are the risk I'll always take 
The only branch I'll never break 
Those fears, we'll blow them all way 
We'll blow them all awayIf you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out

Me out

I'm living on the wild side
I've never seen a footprint
In the land of rivers
You're my only bridge
And I feel the fear in me
And I don't wanna fall asleep
When I turn into someone else
I know that it can't be beat

If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock me out
If you lock 
If you lock
If you lock 
If you lock 
If you lock me

Will you know I am?
(If you lock me)
Will you know you are?
(If you lock me)
Will you know I am?
(If you lock me)
Will you know you are?

I think I've been praying
The lights won't go out
My body's getting colder
As I follow this road down

If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold on)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anything to hold on)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the end)
If you lock me out
(There won't be anyone in the ending)Into me push it deep
Wash the dirt, a hard day's work, know my place

On my own
No poison in my bones
On my own
This is where I build my home

My home
This will always be my home
This will always be my home

I work until it's late
Walk in and closed the gate
I look in the window and gaze at my face

Every line and every abrasion
This took my life to make
This took my life to make

On my own
No poison in my bones
On my own
This is where I build my home

My home
My home

I need someone to hold
I need someone to hold

My home
This will always be my home
This will always be my homeYou left me with your open hands
I never knew what I had to do

Stumbling out in the dark
You left me with a question mark
You said the bridges had to be burned

And it's a pain that only we know
Oh and you lost all on your own
Always has to be a new scare
To keep us falling over the edge

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
Because you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise
Paradise, paradise, paradise

There's a place we try to reach
Impossible as it would seem
I heard you crying out in your sleep

I see that look you save for me
I pull you back upon your feet
I know you always need something more, more

And it's a thing that only we know
Oh and you lost all on your own
Always has to be a new scare
To keep us falling over the edge

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
Because you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise, paradise
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise

I know we're headed for a moment, baby
We made sense of it
I know I struck you so reckless, honey
We gave into it
(Paradise)

I know we're headed for a moment, baby
We made sense of it
(Paradise)
I know I struck you so reckless, honey
We gave in

So, have another drink
Have another drink, call me
If this is what it takes
If it's what it takes, baby
Dream another dream
Because you're killing it, honey
This is what we do to get by

We're always chasing that paradise, paradise,
We're always chasing that paradise, paradise.Who are we to play with hearts? 
And throw away it all 
Who are we to turn each others heads? 
Who are we to find ourselves in other people's beds? 
I don't like the way I never listen to myself 
I feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help 

I don't think you know me much at all 

This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 
I'm feeling down about this love 

Who are you to make me feel so good? 
Who are we to tell ourselves that we're misunderstood? 
Oh who am I to say I'm always yours 
Who am I to choose the boy that everyone adores 
I don't see a reason why we can't just be apart 
Now we're falling on each other like we're always in the dark 

I don't think you warned me much at all 

This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 

This love is not what you want 
This heart will never be yours 
This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 

This love is be and end all 
This love will be your downfall 

You're so quiet 
But it doesn't faze me 
You're on time 
You move so fast 
Makes me feel lazy 

And let's join forces 
We've got our guns and horses 
I know you've been burnt 
But every fire is a lesson learnt 

I left my house 
Left my clothes 
Door wide open 
Heaven knows 
You're so worth it, you are 

But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you 
I would, I would, I would, I would, I would 

Let’s tie words 
'Cause they amount to nothing 
Play it down 
Pretend you can't take what you've found 
But you found me 
On a screen you sit at permanently 

I left my house 
Left my clothes 
Door wide open 
Heaven knows 
You're so worth it, you are 

But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you 
I would, I would, I would, I would 

It's time to come clean and make sense of everything 
It's time that we found out who we are 
'Cause when I'm standing here in the dark 
I see your face in every star 

But I wish I could feel it all for you 
I wish I could be it all for you 
If I could erase the pain 
And maybe you'd feel the same 
I'd do it all for you 
I would, I would, I would, I would, I would 

I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you, I would 
I'd do it all for you 

I had a way then 
Losing it all on my own 
I had a heart then 
But the queen has been overthrown 
And I'm not sleeping now 
The dark is too hard to beat 
And I'm not keeping up 
The strength I need to push me 

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 

Noises, I play within my head 
Touch my own skin 
And hope they'll still be there 
And I think back to when 
My brother and my sister slept 
In another place 
The only time I feel safe 

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 

Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights
Lights, lights

You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong 
And dreaming when they're gone 
Cuz they're calling, calling, calling me home 
Calling, calling, calling home 
You show the lights that stop me turn to stone 
You shine them when I'm alone 

Home, home 
(Lights, lights, lights)... 

You're as sharp as a knife and you fit like a glove 
That is no way to live that is no way to love 
Full of fear in your skin and the weakness in giving in 

Stabbed in the back but you feel no pain 
Push the heaviest doors that you can't open 
Yeah they tied me up and my body lies still, again 

You're as bright as the sun and as bold as the moon 
I don't know when you'll break but it's gonna be soon 
If my will caves in, I'll be in the same boat as you 

I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 

He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
Created just to understand
"The meaning of" 

Hands on strings and my mouth open 
Find the perfect words that I've not spoken 
And I won't tell the truth unless you want me to 

For all of the times that I lost my head 
When it rolled to the floor and I found it again 
But when it came back, 
I didn't know my own name 

I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 

He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
Created just to understand
"The meaning of" 

I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 

He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
Created just to understand 

I've got the salt skin 
Running to where he is 
Never going to give in 
Even with the strength 

He's stealing salt skin 
Telling me I'm winning wars they 
created just to understand...

Oh, oh, starry eyed 
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning 

Handle bars 
That I let go, let go 
For anyone 
Take me in 
And I'll throw out my heart 
And get a new one 

Next thing, we're touching 
You look at me it's like you hit me with lightning 

Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed 
And everybody glows 
Oh 
Everybody's starry eyed

So we burst 
Into colours 
Colours 
And carousels 
Fall head first

Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys

You left your blood stain on the floor 
You set your sights on him 
You left a hand print on the door, 
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before (boys boys boys boys) 

This is our luck, baby, running out 
Her clothes were never off 
We still have hours to run about 
To scale the map, scale the map, to get us back on track 
I've seen you in a fight you lost, I’ve seen you in a fii-ii-ii-ii-ght 

Were under the sheets and you're killing me 
In our house made of paper, your words all over me 
Were under the sheets and you’re killin me 

Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys
Like all the boys before, like all the boys, boys, boys

In here the world won’t bring us down 
Our plan is golden 
Out there a lonely girl could drown 
In here were frozen 

Where did the people go? 
My hands are empty 
You're not the answer I should know 
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before 
(whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,) 

Were in a mess baby, were in a mess babe 
Your more is less babe (oh, oh) 
Were in a mess baby, were in a mess babe 
Your more is less babe (oh, oh!) 

Were under the sheets and you're killin me 
In our house made of paper, and you're words all over me 
We're under the sheets and you’re killin' me 
(I've seen you in a fight you lost) 
Like all the boys before, like all the boys before 
Were under the sheets and your killing me 
Our house full of paper and you're words all over me 
Were under the sheets and you’re killing me 
(Oh you’re killin me, your killin me!!) 

Were under the sheets and you're killing me 
In our house made of paper, your words all over me 
Were under the sheets and you’re killin me 
(killin me, killin me, killin me) 
Killin me, killin me, killin me

I see you're sorry how I'm burning down the gun
With a war in your mind that never wants to be won
I catch you in a light no one else can see
I know you see her, and you'll never see me
She makes you feel the most, keep your souls alive
But what we had, it never really died

And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth
But here's to us, here's to us, here's to us

Yeah, this is just a phase, pretty sure of that
And one day, you and I, we will never look back
You kept me in the flames but the fire was out, the fire was out

And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth

Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh
Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh

And this is what I'll say if I had any words
Wish we hadn't messed up, now your heart is with hers
And I know that your love wasn't here to stay
I gave you all of mine but you gave it away
And now you're the one who hurts
You had to love someone else just to know your worth
But here's to us, here's to us, here's to usBaby I worked this out for sure
It's gonna be colder
Now you've forced open the door
I know you better
Than I ever have before
I know you

I know you're a fighter
But you never fought for me
When I was a shelter
But you're not heading home to me
We could be closer
We could be closer
We could be

When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

It's gonna be (It's gonna be better)
And it's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, oh, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better

We'll take a long walk
Down the alleys of these houses
And we'll talk
See what conversation rouses
When we're alone
When we're alone
It could be home

When it's just us
You show me what it feels like to be lonely
You show me what it feels like to be lost
I take your hand for you to
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

It's gonna be (It's gonna be better)
And it's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, oh, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be better

It's gonna be (It's gonna be better)
And it's gonna be better, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, oh, it's gonna be better
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be better (It's gonna be)
It's gonna be better, it's gonna be betterWe don't have to worry about nothing
'Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They
They're gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race

When the light's turning down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

We don't wanna leave
No, we just gonna be right now, right now
And what we see is everybody's on the floor
Acting crazy, getting loco till the light's out
Music's on, I'm waking up
We start the fire, then we burn it up
And it's over now, we got the love
And there's no sleeping now, no sleeping now

When the light's turning down
They don't know what they heard
Strike the match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn

Girl in the world...

Girl in the world...But it doesn't faze me
You're on dial
You move so fast, makes me feel lazy

Let's join forces
We've got our guns and horses
I know you've been burned
But every fire is a lesson learned

I left my house
Left my clothes
Door wide open, heaven knows
That you're so worth it, you are

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Then maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you, I would

Let's type words
Because they amount to nothing
Play it down
Pretend you can't take what you found
But you found me
On a screen you sit at permanently

I left my house
Left my clothes
Door wide open, heaven knows
You're so worth it, you are

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you, I would

It's time to come clean,
And make sense of everything
It's time that we found out who we are
'Cause when I'm standing here in the dark
I see your face in every star

But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you, I would
I'd do it all for youI wouldn't even flinch
I couldn't try to move
My mind is on you
My mind is on you

If the street lights smashed above me
I wouldn't move an inch
Turn the glass into stars
And your face is the moon

And the night turns to you
'Cause my mind is on you

You got me caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what
I can take anything
I can take anything
I can take anything

If electric charges shock me
I'd smile and fold my arms
I'd feel nothing new
Because my mind is on you
Ooh, my mind is on you
Ooh...

And if the floor gave way to my shoes
I wouldn't try to fly
I can't explain why
I always feel
Always feel you
I always feel
Always feel you

You got me caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what
I can take anything

You're the heat in my bones
Would you break my with stones?
You're the heat in my bones
But you break my with your stones

If a plane crashed into my room
I wouldn't even flinch
I couldn't try to move
My mind is always on you
My mind is always on you

Caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what

Even when I'm caught in a blaze
Panic for a minute
Got my brain in a daze
I wish you weren't in it
There are so many ways
To lose your attention
You can break everything but so what
I can take anythingIs that too much to ask
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask

When I look into your eyes
Boy, I'm feeling delirious
But you know this is serious
I'm sticking to you like glue
Only see you now and then, but I know we could have it all
Because before I was cynical, baby you were just cool

I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong
I could be, I could be, I could be there
If only you'd let me in, I could be there
Just tell me where and tell me when
So tired of these roads going nowhere
But I know your love takes me somewhere

Still looking up and down while you're being mysterious
I see really big things for us
We just need to break through, break through, break through
Everything that you say, god I wish I had said it first
And forgetting I had ever hurt
Your love is pulling me through, me through, me through

I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong

You are all I want
So take me home
The more you been thinking about us
Open up, don't let me go
The more you been thinking about

I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
I just want to be around you
Is that too much to ask
Don't tell I'm wrong, I could be there
Don't tell I'm wrong
I could be there
If only you'd let me in, I could be there
Just tell me where and tell me when
So tired of these roads going nowhere
But I know your love takes me somewhereLips like Tanqueray
Tropical sunrises, never sleeping
I don't know what changed

All I want to do is feel the rhythm of the night
You've been running from the dark
You can't look me in the eyes
Being called into the heat
Even if it's burning me
I just need to dance without you

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
You're not in love

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss

Through the streets and all the places I've been
I can see we never had harmony
I won't go even though I'm alone and I know I want out

I go up without you bringing me down
Such a rush
So now I'm staying to dance on my own
On my own
And all I know is

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
You're not in love

We don't even kiss
I'm not in love
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
You're not in love

Now I'm giving you up tonight
Now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because
We can't move together

Now I'm giving you up tonight
Now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because
We can't move together

Now I'm giving you up tonight
Now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because
We can't move together

Now I'm giving you up tonight
Now I'm giving you up tonight
And I'm dancing on my own because
We can't move to

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
And all I know is

We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss
It never works
We can't move to this
We can't even talk, boy
We don't even kiss

Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
Today I regret the night I put that ring on
He always got them fucking excuses
I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is
I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away, I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hairTell me I'm the problem

And whatever you want, yeah baby I'll bet it comes true

Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm the problem

Yo, baby, what's all this you telling everybody 
We broke up and all this, I'm hearin' off the streets and all, that, ma 
Talk to me or something, huh, I don't know what's goin' on, baby 
You know, I got my clothes in the joint, and you go up here 
Just packin' my gear --- what happened boo?) 

I can't believe I believed, everything we had would last 
So young and naive for me to think, she was from your past 
Silly of me to dream of, one day having your kids 
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong 
I can't believe I fell for four years, and I'm smarter than that 
So young and naive to believe that with me, you're a changed man 
Foolish of me to compete, when you cheat with loose women 
It took me some time but now I moved on, cuz I realized I got 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

So controlling, you said that you love me, but you don't 
Your family told me one day, I would see it on my own 
Next thing I know I'm dealing, with your three kids and my home 
I've been so blind, it feels right when it's wrong 
Now that it's over, stop calling me, come pick up your clothes 
No need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know 
Even your very best friend, tried to warn me on the low 
It took me some time, but now I am strong 
Because I realized I got.. 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

I got me, myself and I (I know that I would never dissapoint myself) 
Must have cried a thousand times (all the ladies if you feel me, help me sing it out) 
I can't regret time spent with you (yeah, you hurt me but I learned a lot the long way) 
But I lucked out to make it through (after all the rain you see the sun come out again) 

See that's why you in my life right now, smile right now.. 
I'm sorry, boo... I'm sorry.. 
Just you know, that you got mature... shoot.. 
Ya'll ladies keep your mouth shut right now 
Cuz ya'll don't know what y'all talking about 
This between me and her, that's my word, she just upset 

Changes... we all go through changes 
Arguments, disagreements, and to some it's dangerous 
But your mind and your heart's clogged with all your pain and 
But a bond that we was holding, what made us famous 
Hey miss, beautiful mami with tears of stone 
Stop cryin', come talk to Tone 
Tell me everything that's goin' wrong like your needs and doubts 
My reason for coming in late, I need cheese and sprouts 
So I could continue to hold down the foundation 
It's pitiful how you could charge me with violations 
Patience is the key, fuck the frustrations 
We act off our emotions and we start hatin' 
And that leads to stress, problems and weight loss 
Total baldness, broke homes come from negative forces 
Baby be cautious, you got to call the cops to get me out 
When it come, babe, I'm goin' all out 
It's T-O-N-E-Y, to Beyonce, my, sweetie pie 
Please try, be mine til we die 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend 

Me myself and I, that's all I got in the end 
That's what I found out, and it ain't no need to cry 
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gonna be my own best friend

We're taking this a little too far

Do you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup...

On my mind up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away
All that I can think of is, we should get married
We should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine

Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

Do you wanna roll with a good girl?
Do it big do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don't sleep when you know you got it good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup...

From 8 until late, I think 'bout you
You're all my nights I don't know what to do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep
This whole thing got way too deep and we should

Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things, let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine

They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace

Burning through my darkest night

But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now

Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
They assure me, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress

It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand

remember the first day  when you took me out 
we had butterflies
although we tried to hide it
and we both had a beautiful night
the way we held each others hands 
the way we talked 
the way we laughed 
it felt so good to find true love 
I knew right then and there you were the one
ohhh 
I know that he loves me cause he told me so 
I know that he loves me cause his feelings show 
when he stares at me 
you see he cares for me 
you see how he's so deep in love 
I know that he loves me cause it's obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts 
and he's missin me  
if he's not kissin me 
and when he looks at me 
his brown eyes tell his soul
remember the first day, the first day we kissed 
remember the first day we had an arguement 
we apologized and then we compromised 
and we haven't argued since 
remember the first day we stopped playing games 
remember the first day you fell in love with me 
it felt so good for you to say those words 
cause I felt the same way too 


the way we held each others hands 
the way we talked 
the way we laughed

and when you looks at me 
his brown eyes tell his soul 
and when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soulBut after a while sweet love just ain't enough
So many settle for less just because
Maybe I'm more in love with what it was
But what's gets so confusing baby
You and me
It's been so much confusion lately
You couldn't see that you were losing me

Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

Won't you just assume he doesn't care
To internalize it all isn't fare
So I address the problem so that he's aware
But I still feel all alone even when he's there
Maybe we can fix it baby
I know we can
If I make you miss it baby
Then maybe you will understand

That I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me company

la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa
la la la la la la la la laaa

Well I'm alone now but I ain't lonely
I'm on my own now
But I ain't the only
Honestly I'm fine
I'll take this time to concentrate on me
And I got possibility to keep me companyOut in the darkness with no guide 
I know the cost of a losing hand 
There but for the grace of God go I 

I found heaven on earth 
You were my last, my first 
And then I hear this voice inside 
Ave Maria 

I've been alone 
When I'm surrounded by friends 
How could the silence be so loud 
But I still go home knowing that I've got you 
There's only us when the lights go down 

You are my heaven on earth 
You are my hunger, my thirst 
I always hear this voice inside 
Singing Ave Maria 

Sometimes love can come and pass you by 
While your busy making plans 
Suddenly hit you and then you realize 
It's out of your hands, baby you got to understand 

You are my heaven on earth 
You are my last, my first 
And then I hear this voice inside 
Ave Maria 
Ave Maria

Hey!

He said I'm worth it
his one desire
(I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about)
He kissed me
his one and only
this beautiful liar
(Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about)

We'll never know
why are we the ones who suffer?
have to let go
he won't be the one to cry

[Chorus]:
Let's not kill the karma
let's not start a fight
it's not worth the drama for a beautiful liar
can't we laugh about it
ha ha
it's not worth our time
oh
we can live without him just a beautful liar

I trusted him, but when I followed you
I saw you together
(I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him again)
I walked in 
on your love scene
slow dancing
(you stole everything how can you say I did you wrong?)

We'll never know
when the pain and heartbreak's over
have to let go
the innocence is gone

[Chorus]

Tell me how to forgive you
when it's me who's ashamed
and I wish I could free you
of the hurt and the pain
but the answer is simple-
he's the one to blame

Some women, were made 
But me, myself
I like to think that I was created 
For a special purpose
You know, what's more special than you, you feel me? 

It's on, baby let's get lost 
You don't need to call into work, 'cuz you the boss 
For real, want you to show me how you feel 
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal 

Why, well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets
You didn't know was inside,
No need for me to lie

It's too big 
It's too wide 
It's too strong 
It won't fit 
It's too much

'Cuz he can back it up 
He got a big ego 
Such a huge ego 
I love his big ego 
It's too much 
He walk like this 
'Cuz he can back it up 

Usually I'm humble
Right now I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find 
On what I'm working with 
Damn I know, I'm killing you with them legs 
Better yet them thighs 
Matter a fact it's my smile 
Or maybe my eyes 
Boy you a sight to see 
Kind of something like me 

It's too big 
It's too wide 
It's too strong 
It won't fit 
It's too much 
It's too tough 
I talk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 
I got a big ego 
Such a huge ego 
But he love my big ego 
It's too much 
I walk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 
I, I walk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 
I, I talk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 
I, I can back it up 
I can back it up 
I walk like this 
'Cuz I can back it up 

It's too big 
It's too wide 
It's too strong 
It won't fit 
It's too much 
It's too tough 
He talks like this

And although I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, oh, babe
Every promise don't work out that way

Dishes smashed on my counter from our last encounter
Pictures snatched out the frame
Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face
What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
Well every promise don't work out that way, no, no, babe
Well every promise don't work out that way

And your heart is broken 'cause I walked away
Show me your scars and I won't walk away
And I know I promised that I couldn't stay, baby
Every promise don't work out that way, no, no, no, no, no
Every promise don't work out that wayBy the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hail'd
At the twilight's
last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes
And bright stars
Thro' the perilous fight

O'er the ramparts we watch'd
Were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave proof thro' the night
That our flag was still there
O say
Does that star-spangled banner
Yet wave
O'er the land of the free
And the home of the brave?Best foot first just in case
When we made our way till now
It's time to listen, it's time to fight

Forward
Now we're going to hold doors open for a while
Now we can be open for a while

Forward
I love you more than this job, please don't work for me

Forward
Go back to your sleep in your favorite spot just next to me
Forward, forwardBitch, I'm back by popular demand

Thinkin' 'bout the things been said,
when you really don't know me yet.

Gotta clear up some things
there have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved.
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya,
give it a rest.

And let me live mine.

Dangerously in love, yeah, yeah...

I am in love with you - you set me free;
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me, (Can't do this thing, yeah...)
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you; (I love you, I love you, I love you, I'll never leave!)
I'll never leave - just, just keep lovin' me the way I love you lovin' me, (Keep lovin' me, oh...)

I love to see you walk into the room 
Body shining, lightin' up in the place 
And when you talk everybody stop 
'Cuz they know you know just what to say and 
The way that you protect your friends 
Baby, I respect you for that 
And when you roll you take everyone you love along 
I love that shit

Don't fly me away 
You don't need to buy a diamond key 
To unlock my heart

'Cuz you know there's more to life 
And if I need ya, you will be here, you will make the sacrifice 

Don't fly me away 
You don't need to buy a diamond key 
To unlock my heart 
You shelter my soul 
You're my fire when I'm cold

Hello ooooohI been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
(If I let you go)
Sit in the house off the coast
(If I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

She gon' rock the V.V.S. stones
(If I let you go)
Cruise in the 'Bach or the Rolls
(If I let you go)
She gon' pocket everything I tote
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog?
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers
Accusations, what you mean you gon' choke?

You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spendin' yo' dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture-perfect movie everyone would have saw

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
(If I let you go)
Sit in the house off the coast
(If I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

She gon' rock the V.V.S. stones
(If I let you go)
Cruise in the 'Bach or the Rolls
(If I let you go)
She gon' pocket everything I tote
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

Ring the alarm
I been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it, and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

He so done, workin' 'em both
She gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call--time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
(If I let you go)
Sit in the house off the coast
(If I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

She gon' rock the V.V.S. stones
(If I let you go)
Cruise in the 'Bach or the Rolls
(If I let you go)
She gon' pocket everything I tote
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show, and I won't let you go
All is been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
(If I let you go)
Sit in the house off the coast
(If I let you go)
She gon' take everything I own
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

She gon' rock the V.V.S. stones
(If I let you go)
Cruise in the 'Bach or the Rolls
(If I let you go)
She gon' pocket everything I tote
(If I let you go)
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you goI live my life to the fullest 
Party every chance I get 
Friday nights, "The Spot" is the place I hit 
Decked out, chest out 
Me and my girls roll up in "The Spot" like we own the world 
You should see the eyes on me, dress fittin' like a prize on me 
High split , fellas get the rise on me 
Just from the looks of it , I must say 
You're bound to get hooked on it, if you play 

(Mekhi)

Your optomistic for someone goin to jail 

(Beyonce)

Would you stop bein' so damn stale 
I know you gotta girl but damn dont you wanna see new things 
Security shouldn't purchase a ring 

(Mekhi)

So why you lookin at me like that? 
Like what you say is true? 

(Beyonce)

I know your type I see through you 

(Mekhi)

Oh yea? What you see?? 
Cause I love my girl it's not about security I give her the world 
Shes down for and always has been 

(Beyonce)

And I would be, too, if I was your girlfriend 
But I'm not 
I even take you too "The Spot", bring sand to the beach, keep you on a leash, 
I know how thirsty these chicks could be 
Schemin and plottin on you, like me 

(Mekhi)

Listen, you a little too hot for a guy like me 
You and I are unlikely
My girl is more like me she just cool, you know? 
Not a risk-taker she just goes with the flow 

(Beyonce)

Shes wack You need a little spice in ya life 
Live a little you'll see what you want in a wife is in me 
I'm tellin you its like gold, 
Hard to let go, Harder to hold 
I'll dance with you slowly, too a hip-hop joint 
And only stop on a positive, you got the point? 

(Mekhi)

I dont dance, I dont drink I dont like clubs I'm not impressed 
I dont smoke, only scrubs go to different places and fall for pretty faces, 
To me, ya'll are all  basic 

(Beyonce)

And your life is wasted, 
Thats why you're a cop 
You never got to taste it if you had one drop, 
You wouldn't go back 
I'll prove it to you, 
Come out with me tonight, that'll do it for youAnd that's why they're beautiful....
And my heart used to be cold 'til your hands laid on my soul,
Baby, and that's why you're beautiful...

I'm not wondering why the sky's blue - that's not my business;
All I know is I look up and tell myself, "Be patient, love... that could be us..."

The lovers used to make love, not just to give us their piece of the beautiful...
Remember when we made love? Love... wasn't it beautiful?

Don't ask me why the sky's blue - that's not my business;
All I know is I look up and tell myself, "Be patient, love... that could be us..."

Diamonds used to be coal (be coal), look young 'cause they got soul (got soul),
And my heart used to be cold (be cold), 'til your hands laid on my soul... (my soul...)
Somebody's got to stay deep in love;
That could be us...
That's why we're beautiful...
That's why you're beautiful...

Ooh...
Oh, I... oh, I...

That's why we're beautiful...
That's why you're beautiful...
That's why you're beautiful...I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle yes indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day.

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfections
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
and that's exactly what I mean.

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love youBa-ba-ba-da, ba-ba-ba... ba-ba-ba... Bring the beat in!

Honey, honey, I can see the stars all the way from here;
Can't you see the glow on the windowpane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near;
Every time you touch me, I just melt away...

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear;
(People say "Love hurts,") but I know (it's gonna take a little work...) Whoa-oh!
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fightin' through my tears,
And finally, you put me first!

Baby, it's you! 
You're the one I love (one I love), you're the one I need! (I need...)
You're the only one I see!
Come on, baby, it's you! (It's you...)
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one I can always call! (Always call...)
When I need you, make everything stop - Finally, you put my love on top!
Ooh! Come on, baby! 
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top...
You put my love on top!
Ooh-ooh! Come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top, put my love on top, my love on top...

Baby, baby, I can hear the wind whipping past my face,
As we dance the night away...
And boy, your lips taste like a night of champagne, 
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again...

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear;
(People say "Love hurts,") but I know (that's it's gonna take a little work...) Oh-whoa, oh...
Nothin's perfect, but it's worth it after fightin' through my tears,
And finally, you put me first!

Baby, it's you! 
You're the one I love (one I love), you're the one I need! (I need...)
You're the only one I see!
Come on, baby, it's you! (It's you...) 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one I can always call! (Always call...)
When I need you, make everything stop - Finally, you put my love on top!
Ooh! Baby! 
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top...
You put my love on top!
Ooh-ooh! Come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top, put my love on top, my love on top...

Baby, it's you! 
You're the one I love (one I love), you're the one I need! (I need...)
You're the only thing I see!
Come on, baby, it's you! (It's you...) 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one that always calls! (Always call...)
When I need you, baby, everything stops - Finally, you put my love on top!

Baby! You're the one that I love! Baby, you're all I need!
You're the only one I see!
Come on, baby, it's you! 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one I always call! (Calls...)
When I need you, everything stops - Finally, (you put my) love on top!

Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love! Baby, you're the one that I need!
You're the only man I see...
Oh, baby, baby, it's you! 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one that always calls... (Calls...)
When I need you, everything stops - Finally, you put my love on top!

Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love! (Love!) Baby, you're the one that I need! (Need!)
You're the only one I see... (See...)
Oh, baby, baby, it's you! 
You're the one that gives your all! You're the one that always calls! (Call...)
When I need you, everything stops - Finally, you put my love on top!Te olvidé, te olvidé

(mmm)

Ya lo ves, ya loves

Ya lo ves, amor, esta vez te olvidé
en el closet, en un rincón
están tus cosas, esto se acabó (se acabó)
Te juro que no te aguanto más
no te quiero ya, ni como amante
Esta vez no ganarás, te puedes marchar
y no vuelvas jamás

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
ya verás, que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate

¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
tu creías que eras imprescindible
pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte...
a olvidar tu amor

Ya me curé de dolor, ya te saqué de mi corazón
vete con ella, solos los dos
pobre de ti, lárgate, me das asco
Tu eres mi luz
pero hay amores que matan de daño
Me cansé de ti
ya no soy aquella infeliz

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
ya verás, que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate

¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
tu creías que eras imprescindible
pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte
voy a olvidar tu amor

Ya no soy nada para ti
alguien que no conoces
Lo nuestro se acabó
tanto daño al fin lo destruyó (destruyó)
Nunca lloraré por ti
porque ya me cansé de ti
No eres más imprescindible

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
te olvidé, te olvidé

(mmm)

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
ya lo ves, amor, esta vez te olvidé

Te olvidé, te olvidé

Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte...
voy a olvidar tu amor

¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
tu creías que eras imprescindible
pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
¿Qué sabes tu de mi? No me hagas reir
me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte...

¿Qué sabes tu de mi? (baby) No me hagas reir
tu creías que eras imprescindible
pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme
(No hay más que hablar, terminamos)
¿Qué sabes tu de mi? (Este cuento al fin se he acabado) No me hagas reir
me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves, traidor, voy a sustituirte...

Sending me a drink ain't appeasing, believe me

Come harder; this won't be easy
Don't doubt yourself; trust me, you need me
This ain't no shoulder with a chip or an ego
But what you think they all mad at me for?

You need a real woman in your life (that's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (that's a good look)
And I'm-a help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look; ladies that's a good look)
Believe me, when you're in them big meetings for the mils (that's a good look)
You take me just to complement the deal (that's a good look)
And anything you cop, I split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look; ladies, that's a good look)
Believe me

[Chorus]
Partner, let me upgrade ya
Auda Marva Kade ya
Switch ya necktie to purple labels
Upgrade ya
I can up
Can I up
Let me up
Upgrade ya
Partner, let me upgrade ya
Partner, let me upgrade ya
Flip a new page
Introduce you to some new things and
Upgrade ya
I can up
Can I up
Let me up
Upgrade ya
Partner, let me upgrade ya

I can do for you what Martin did for the people
Ran by the man, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equal
Still play my part and let you take the lead role
Believe me

I'll follow; this could be easy
I'll be the help whenever you need me
I see your hustle; with my hustle I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

You need a real woman in your life (that's a good look)
Taking care of home and still fly (that's a good look)
I can help you build up your account
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look; ladies that's a good look)
Believe me, when you're in them big meetings for the mils (that's a good look)
You take me just to complement the deal (that's a good look)
Anything you cop, I split the bill
(That's a good look, better yet a hood look; ladies, that's a good look)
Believe me

[Chorus]

I be the b-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, Bubbles, Loraine Schwartz sorta dude
It's big ballin', baby, when I'm courtin' you
I'm talking spa bags and fly pads and rooms at the Bloomberg
And rumors you on the verge of a new marriage
'Cause that rock on your finger's like a tumor
You can't fit your hand in your new purse
It's humorous to me; they watchin' and we just yachtin'
Island hoppin' off the Omafi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn
No, not the car, but everywhere we are?
You sure to see stars
This is high-level, not eye-level
My bezzle courtesy of Auda Marv
I'll order yours tomorrow; now look at the time I saved ya
Mama, let me upgrade ya

Just when you think you had it all
Big ends, car notes, collectin' cars
Picture your life elevated with me
Make you my project celebrity
I'll keep your name hot in them streets

It's that little glimpse of light
That makes the diamond really shine
And you already is a star
But unless you're flawless
Then your dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

[Chorus]

Auda Marva Kay watch
Dimples in your neck tie
Hermez briefcase
Cartier top clips
Silk line blazers
Diamond cream facials
VVS cuff links
Six star pimp suites
Partner, let me upgrade ya, grade ya
Partner, partner, let me upgrade ya, grade ya
Let me, let me, let me upgrade ya, grade ya
Partner, partner, partner, let me upgrade yaI love to love you, baby

I'm feeling sexy
I want to hear you say my name, boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame

Feeling kind of horny
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just takin' over me
To start feelin' so crazy, babe
Lately I feel the funk comin' over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe

[Chorus]
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm calling all my girls
We're gon' turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
Tonight I'm calling all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party

You're so sexy; tonight I am all yours, boy
The way your body moves across the floor, boy

Feeling kind of horny
I might just take you home with me
Baby, the minute I feel your energy
The vibe is just takin' over me
To start feelin' so crazy, babe
Lately I feel the funk comin' over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy, babe

[Chorus]

I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby
I love to love you, baby

[Chorus: x2]But now everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Loving you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied 
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

Just can't seem to get over 
The way you hurt me
I dont know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing 
The very thing you gave to me 
I thought I could forgive you and I know you've changed 
As much as I wanna trust you I know it ain't the same 
And it's all because you lied 

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this (Forget this)
But I'm much too full of resentment (I'm much too full of resentment)

I may never understand why
I'm doing the best that I can and 
I tried and I tried to forget this (Forget this)
I'm much too full of resentment

I'll always remember feeling (you lied) like I was no good (you lied)
Like I couldn't do it for you, like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied

Loved you more than ever (you lied)
More than my own life (you lied)
The best part of me I gave you (you lied)
It was sacrificed (Sacrificed)
And it's all because you lied 

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like (I can't go on and pretend)
I tried and I tried to forget this (I tried and I tried and I tried)
But I'm too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive but I was here first
I've been riding with you for six years
Why did I deserve
To be treated this way by you
I know you probably thinking
"What's up with B?"
I've been crying for too long 
What did you do to me?

I use to be so strong
Now you took my soul
I'm crying, can't stop crying
Can't stop crying

You could've told me
You wasn't happy
I know you didn't want to hurt me 
But look what you've done to me now 

I gotta look at her in her eyes (you lied)
And see she's had half of me (you lied)
How could you lie? (How could you lie?)Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go

Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off the phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleeping alone

I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waiting for me to come home
To come home

If I were a boy
I think I could understand, oh, ooh
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man

I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (you wanted)
Cause he's taken you for granted (for granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you'll wish you were a better man

You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything that you had got destroyed

But you're just a boyOut in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
But for the grace of God go I

I found heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

I've been alone
When I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home
Knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down

You are my heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria

Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hit you and then you realize
It's out of your hands
Baby, you got to understand

You are my heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave MariaWhen I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

I didn't want no man
I didn't wanna fall in love, and
I didn't care about your girl
I didn't care how we would end up

But that was then, this is now
I think I'm experiencing love
I don't wanna wreck up your home
That's why I'm convinced, I gotta go

[Chorus]

Everytime she calls, you expect
Me to disappear like we never met
At first I didn't mind, but now I
Sometimes feel like you're all mine

You told me it was all about me, me
It's not about me if your still with her
Now I've realized that I've gotta move on
It might be hard, but I,
I gotta move on

[Chorus]

I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)
I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)
[Repeat to fade]You better sit down and look around
Cause you must've bumped yo' head
And I love you enough to talk some
sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home, me the kids
And the dog is gone
Check my credentials...
I give you everything you want
everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why?

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

I got beauty, I got class
I got style, and I got ass
And you don't even care to care Looka here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
Now, now now now now now now
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune Ooh.....

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

There's nothing not to love about me
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me I'm lovely
There's nothing not to need about me
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just plain....... DUMBFever

Another world, another life

When I leave this world, I'll leave no regrets,
Leave something to remember, so they won't forget...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know - I was here....

I want to say I lived each day until I die,
And know that I meant something in somebody's life...
The hearts that I touched will be the proof that I leave
That I made a difference, and this world will see...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I will leave my mark so everyone will know - I was here....

I just want them to know that I gave my all, did my best, brought someone some happiness,
Left this world a little better, just because I was here...

I was here;
I lived, I loved - I was here...
I did... I've done everything that I wanted, and it was more than I thought it would be;
I want to leave my mark so everyone will know...

I was here;
(I lived,) I lived... (I loved...) 
I was here...
(I did,) I did! (I've done...) 
I was here!

Tell me Lord, What did I ever do
That was worth loving you Or the Kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me Jesus, My Soul's in your Hand.

Try me Lord, If you think there's a Way
I can try to repay All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself On my Way back to you.

Yes Lord, help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so

Ooo, I see you coming over making your move; I'm waiting on you to
Ooo, tell me what I wanna hear
Ooo, whisper something in my ear
Ooo, So you're making me feel sexy; baby, we can get up out of here

[Chorus]
What's it gonna be, boy?
I'm watching you, you watching me
What's it gonna be, boy?
Can't you feel this chemistry?
What's it gonna be, boy?
It's so damn crowded we should leave
What's it gonna be, boy?
Tell me, what's it gonna be?

Can we take it there?
Club's about to close; give me one more dance, then I'm ready to go
When the deejay's playing all the same songs, then the night's about to end
Can we meet in the parking lot, find a quiet place where we can talk
To find out more about each other, baby, can we?

Ooo, I wanna get closer
Ooo, baby, let me show ya
Ooo, I'm glad you came over and made your move; now tell me what you wanna do
Ooo, tell me what I wanna hear
Ooo, whisper something in my ear
Ooo, You're making me feel sexy, baby, we should get up out of here

What's it gonna be, boy?
I'm watching you, you watching me
What's it gonna be, boy?
Can't you feel this chemistry?
What's it gonna be, boy?
This place is crowded; we should leave
What's it gonna be, boy?
Tell me, what's it gonna be?


You know I'm feeling you (I'm feeling you)
Tonight's on; let's find a spot (you feeling me)
To go so we can get to know each other better
I'll go and tell my girls (I'll tell my girls)
If you go and tell your boys (Go tell your boys)
We gon' be leaving; tell me, what's it gonna be?
You know I'm feeling you (I'm feeling you)
Tonight's on; let's find a spot (you feeling me)
To go so we can get to know each other better
I'll go and tell my girls (I'll tell my girls)
If you go and tell your boys (Go tell your boys)
We gon' be leaving; tell me, what's it gonna be?

[Chorus]

What's it gonna be, boy?
I'm watching you, you watching me
What's it gonna be, boy?
What's it gonna be, boy?
What's it gonna be, boy?
Tell me, what's it gonna be?
What's it gonna be, boy?
What's it gonna be, boy?
What's it gonna be, boy?[Verse 1]
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day having your kids
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

[Chorus]
Me, Myself and I that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And there ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I will be my own best friend

[Repeat Chorus]

So controlling to say that you love me but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over stop calling me come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like your still with me all your homies know
Even your very best friend try to warn me on the low
Took me some time but now I am strong
Because I realized I got

[Chorus]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
Got me, myself and I
(I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(All the ladies if you feel me help me sing it out)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Yeah you hurt me but I learned alot along the way)
So I have vowed to make it through
(After all the rain you'll see the sun come out again)

[Repeat Chorus]

Oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh)
Oh (oh) oh (oh) oh (oh) woo woo (woo woo)

Yeah

[Bridge]
Now I've got me, myself and I (I know that I will never disappoint myself)
I must have cried a thousand times
(If ya cried a thousand times ladies you will survive)
I can't regret time spent with you
(Yeah, ya hurt me but I learned a lot along the way)
So I have vowed to make it through (After all the rain you'll see the sun come again)I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at
Just one shot left of this drink
In this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise
And I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling
That's because I'm jealous

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this

Take it one step further
Freakum dress out my closet
Beyoncé fillin' out this skirt
I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat
Boy, you'll been hanging out alright tonight
I'm staying out till tomorrow
Been dancing on them tables
Ain't got no cares, no sorrows
I ran into my ex
Said what up to his bestest
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas
Don't be jealous

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh you're jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh you're jealous

Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I'll never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
Baby girl you can't survive like this no, no, no

And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous
I'm just human
Don't judge me

If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealous
If you're keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh I'm jealousShow you how much I appreciate you
Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you
Wanna show you how much I will forever be true

Wanna show you how much you got your girl feelin' good
Wanna show you how much, how much you're understood
Wanna show you how much, I value what you say
Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me bay

Wanna show you how much, I really care about yo' heart
I wanna show ya how much, I hate being apart
Show ya, show ya, show ya til you're through with me
I wanna keep it how it is, so you can never say how it used to be

(Bridge)
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

(Chorus)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body

You'll never need two, 'cuz I will be your number one
Them other chicks are superficial
But I know you know I'm the one
That's why I'm all into you

'Cuz I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backin' this thing back
Pop-poppin' this thing back
Drop-drop-drop-dropping this thing back

This is for the time, you gave me flowers
For the world, that is ours
For the mulah, for the power of love
I know I won't never ever eh-ever give you up

And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and the freak in the you know what
Sit back sit back it's the pre game show
Daddy you know what's up

(Bridge)
Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock, sit back and watch

(Chorus)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)

Imma take this time
To show you how much you mean to me
'Cuz you all I need
No money can emphasize or describe
The love that's in between the lines
Boy look into my eyes

While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel

Rockin' on you babe
Rockin' rockin' on you babe
Swirlin' on you babe
In my mind all I can think about
Is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past
And a chance to make this love last

(Chorus)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you (ohh ooh ohh ohhh)
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body

Once i got that feeling for you

Beyoncé

Once you started calling for me
Fell deep
Living in deniel
Couldn't see what you saw in me

And i can't deny it's how i feelI'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

Check it out, you can catch me on top now, playin a club
Throwin a shot down, tryin to stay above
Ground, another ground-breakin day in the club
Surrounded by my home thoughts, playin a cut
Reminesin on days I didn't have a pot to piss in
No watches to glisin, no V's with hot systems
Missin my homies that passed right in front of my eyes
Due to the fast life we told wonderful lies
On how we would live forever, time proved us wrong
Had to get our shit together and move it along
Had dreams of being Big niggas, Jig niggas
Drivin the hottest cars, movin out with our moms and I'm

Wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means

Was interuppted by this chicken that I used to cluck wit
Back in the days when I was movin much shit, "What up chick?"
Maintanin, it's the same old thang
A little stress, a little bullshit, ain't too much changed
I see you kept it movin, you see I kept improving, she nodded her head in agreement
Remember when I used to walk up and down the cement, puttin it down
While the Streets is Watchin, stay hooded down
Just to earn a rep, but what good is it now?
She said "Damn I just stopped to say Hi.... Bye"
I was too deep for you from day one
Thats why we never had relations, continued in my own zone

I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever done

Uh huh, We used to play tap-tap for rap tracks
Run, catch, and kiss in the back park until it got dark
Wanted to be like the older fellas, sneak and drink old Chample
Dangerous games we played on the third rail
Fiend for the summer breeze
Hopped out the Lee's Dungrares
into the Hawaiian shorts, relying on sports
to take us away from here, but I cut too much
So I had a plan B used to rhyme with a brush
My sinners used to back me up
Like Doug E. Fresh and Ricky D., Eric, Mickey and Me
All my niggas is you with me, each of ya'll
Let's reach for the stars now... Jigga!

I'm wishing on a star to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying it will come
And I'm wishing on all the loving we've ever doneSlowly as Sir Luscious step up like a Q-Dawg
A-town's up, deuces down it's the new call
And you can dial 1-888-CUT-SOMETHING
I'm your kinky operator when you wanna fuck something
Ain't no dial tones just milestones, of pleasure to reach
To each his own, I'm a stone cold Aquarian freak
Humanitarian, barbarian but under the sheets
It's the player from the Point
And your girl from the D

ARE YOU INFATUATED WITH ME
I COULD END YOUR CURIOSITY
IF YOU DON'T THINK I'M TOO RUDE

For a girl, spendin' time alone can be pretty rough...

But I get a knock on my door;
You know it's yours, for sure...
We can't wait for the bedroom, so we just hit the floor...

With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you 
When I close my eyes 
I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hand and be my guide

Clouds filled with stars cover  skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this? 

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you 
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare 
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true

I mention you when I say my prayers 
I wrap you around all of my thoughts 
Boy you're my temporary high 
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby 
What kinda dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

You decided to dip  and now you wanna trip 
'Cause another brother noticed me

I'm up on him , he up on me 
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause I cried my tears , gave ya three good years 
You can't be mad at me

And we tighter than my Deréon jeans
Actin' up , drank in my cup 
I can care less what you think

I need no permission, did I mention
Don't pay him any attention
'Cause you had your turn , and now you gon' learn
What it really feels like to miss B

Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve

Is a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms, say I'm the one you want
If you don't, you'll be alone
And like a ghost, I'll be gone

Oh-oh-ohYou know I got my top back and my beat low, rockin’ my stunna shades and turnin’ up my radio...
Turn up my radio...

I think I'm in love with my radio, 'cause it never lets me down;
And I fall in love with my stereo whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,)
Whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...)
Whenever I hear that sound...

You're the only one that Papa allowed to hang out in my room;
With the door closed, we'd be alone...
And Mama never freaked out when she heard it go boom,
'Cause she knew we were in the zone...

Hold him in my arms, and look out of my window (under the moonlight),
And he'd be keeping me calm, so I never let him go;
He's got a place in my heart...

I think I'm in love with my radio, 'cause it never lets me down;
And I fall in love with my stereo (with my stereo-o-o...) whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...

When I get into my car, I turn it uh-uh, uh-up,
Then I hear vibrations all up in my truh-uh, uh-unk,
And the bassline be rattling through my se-ee, ee-ats,
Then that crazy feeling starts happeni-ing, ee-ing, oh...
I get butterflies when I hear the DJ (playing the stuff I like)
And I fall deeper in love with every song he plays;
He’s got a place in my heart...

I think I’m in love with my radio, 'cause it never lets me down;
And I fall in love with my stereo whenever I hear that sound....
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...

I be on the hotline like erryday, makin’ sure the DJ know what I want him to play;
You know I got my top back and my beat low, rockin’ my stunna shades and turnin’ up my radio...
Turn up my radio...

I think I’m in love with my radio, 'cause it never lets me down;
And I fall in love with my stereo whenever I hear that sound....
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Whenever I hear that sound...

Oh-whoa-whoa...
Oh-whoa-whoa...
Oh-whoa-whoa, oh...You can have the love you need to live...
But if you look for truthfulness, you might just as well be blind -
It always seems to be so hard to give...

Honesty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard,
And mostly what I need from you...

I can always find someone to say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve...
But I don't want some pretty face to tell me pretty lies;
All I want is someone to believe...

Honesty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard,
And mostly what I need from you...

I can find a lover, I can find a friend;
I can have security until the bitter end...
Anyone can comfort me with promises again, I know...

When I'm deep inside of me, don't be too concerned;
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone...
But when I want sincerity, tell me, where else can I turn,
When you're the one that I depend upon?

-esty is such a lonely word;
Everyone is so untrue...
Honesty is hardly ever heard;
Mostly what I need from you...I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love
I love you Houston

And I've been drifting off of knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks
Man these women getting solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wander
How come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge
I preach my gut it can't help ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cuz all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring
All these record labels boring
I don’t trust these record labels, I’m touring
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive...
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
How come?

What goes up
Ghost around
Ghost around

What goes up
Ghost around
Ghost around...

Soul not for sale
Prob’ly won’t make no money off this
Oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so... Umh

It’s what you do
It’s what you see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, you must be on to me

You want me?
I walk down the hallway
You lucky?
The bedroom's the wrong way
Slap me, I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

My haunted lungs
Ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm on to you
You must be on to me

It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you
You must be haunting me
It's where we go
It's where we'll be
I know if I'm on to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you

You must be onto me
(Onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me
(Onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me
(Onto you, I'm onto you)
You must be onto me
(Onto you, I'm onto you)

Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)
Me (onto you, I'm onto you)"Miss Third Ward, your first question. What is your aspiration in life?"
: "Hoh... my aspiration in life? Would be... to be happy."

Mama said, "You're a pretty girl;
What's in your head, it doesn't matter...
Brush your hair, fix your teeth;
What you wear is all that matters..."

Just another stage, pageant the pain away;
This time, I'm gonna take the crown without falling down, down, down...

Pretty hurts;
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
Perfection is a disease of a nation;
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...

Pretty hurts;
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see;
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

Blonder hair, flat chest;
TV says, "Bigger is better..."
South Beach, sugar-free;
Vogue says, "Thinner is better...."

Just another stage, pageant the pain away;
This time, I'm gonna take the crown without falling down, down, down...

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
Perfection is a disease of a nation;
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts... (Pretty hurts...)

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst...
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see;
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away;
The pain's inside, and nobody frees you from your body...
It's my soul, it's my soul that needs surgery;
It's my soul that needs surgery...

Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far,
Then you break when the fake facade leaves you in the dark
You're left with shattered mirrors, and the shards of a beautiful girl...

Pretty hurts; (Oh, oh...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst... (Pretty hurts...)
Perfection is a disease of a nation; (Pretty hurts...)
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...

Pretty hurts; (Pretty hurts...)
We shine the light on whatever's worst... (Oh! Oh, oh...)
You try to fix something, but you can't fix what you can't see; (Pretty hurts...)
It's the soul that needs the surgery...

When you're alone all by yourself, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
and you're lying in your bed, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Reflection stares right into you; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
You stripped away the masquerade, (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
The illusion has been shed; (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)
Are you happy with yourself? (Pretty hurts, pretty hurts...)

Yes...You didn't know I was a risk, and it's such a crying shame
How you gave me all of you and wanted nothing else from me
But to make some time for you, but all I made you was lonely...

I couldn't see, but now I know that I acted selfishly;
I should've known that I'd let you down and cause you so much misery...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...

I should've been there...
I should've been there...
I should've been there...
I should've been there...

All of the times you used to cry because I would let you down;
I'm losin' time! I should've tried a little more to be around...
But I didn't know that you were hurting, I was just too blind;
Only thing I know for certain: another you, I'll never find...

I couldn't see, but now I know that I acted selfishly;
I should've known that I'd let you down and cause you so much misery...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...

I should've been there...
I should've been there...
I should've been there...
I should've been there...

I'm filled with regret - I'm gonna tip and soak myself in misery;
Now in your life, I'll take more time - No more yearning without me...
But, it hurts to think of you all by yourself, but now I see,
And I apologize for all the times I left you home waiting for me...

I couldn't see, but now I know that I acted selfishly;
I should've known that I'd let you down and cause you so much misery...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...
Forever to bleed... forever to bleed...

I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there...

I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there... (I'm gonna be there...)
I'm gonna be there...Ya lo ves, ya lo ves, ya lo ves amor esta vez, te olvide!
En el closet, en un rincon estan tus cosas, esto se acabo!

Te juro que ya no te aguanto más,
no te quiero ya ni como amante
esta vez no ganarás,
te puedes marchar,
y no vuelvas jamas
Y si acaso piensas,
que esta vez voy a perdonar,
ya verás que nunca más
me vuelves a engañar,
ya largate!

que sabes tu de mi no me hagas reir,
tu creías que eras imprecindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby
que sabes tu de mi no me hagas reir,
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte,a olvidar tu amor

Ya me cure del dolor,
ya te saqué de mi corazón
Vete con ella solos los dos
Pobre de ti, largate me das asco
Tu eres mi luz, Pero hay amores
que matan de daño
me canse de ti,
ya no soy aquella infeliz

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez
voy a perdonar, ya verás
Que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya largate

que sabes tu de mi, no me hagas reir,
tu creías que eras imprescindible


Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme,baby
que sabes tu de mi no me hagas reir,
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte,
voy a olvidar tu amor

ya no soy nada para ti
alguien que no conoces
Lo nuestro se acabó
tanto daño al fin lo destruyó
Nunca lloraré por ti
Porque ya me cansé de ti
No eres mas inprescindible

ya lo ves ya lo ves,
te olvidé, te olvidé
ya lo ves ya lo ves,
ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
Te olvidé, te olvidé
ya lo ves traidor voy sustituirte
voy a olvidar tu amor

que sabes tu de mi, no me hagas reir
tu creias que eras imprescindible
pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme,baby
que sabes tu de mi, no me hagas reir
Me veras con otro hombre a mi lado
ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte,baby

que sabes tu de mi, no me hagas reir

No hay mas que hablar terminamos
este cuento al fin se ha acabado

ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
voy a olvidar tu amor!No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Oye (mm-hmm) como llora mi canción
Preciso tu atención debes oír
Hoy no se quien soy ni se adonde voy
Encontrarme hoy es mi missión
De tu prisón por fin ya soy libre

Oye
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Hoy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Que nada en valor voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz

Nunca quisiste que me fuera a volar
Hallar mi identidad, que gran error
Hoy grito no tengo más temor
Hoy tu alumna te dice adiós
De tu prisón por fin ya soy libre

Oye
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Hoy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz

Yo soy tu gran criación
Por eso es que me voy
Dime adiós, dime adiós

Oye, lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Ya me voy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor hoy ya lo decidí
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz
mi voz.Body shining lightin' up the place
And when you talk, everybody stop
'Cause I know you know just what you sayin'

The way that you protect your friends
Baby I respect you for that
And when you grow you'll take everyone you love along
I love that shit

Don't fly me away
Don't need to buy a diamond key to unlock my heart
You shelter my soul, you're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know

You had me at hello
Hello, hello
You had me at hello

Or my football playa friend whose been beggin me to end it 
My attorney on Brickle wit a big popsicle

To have ya'll hatin on me,

Sometimes I shake my head,
when I'm layin' down in my bed.
Thinkin' 'bout the things been said,
when you really don't know me yet.

Gotta clear up some things
there have been many things said about me!
So many opinions, so many judgements, preconcieved.
It's outta my character for me to feed in to ya,
give it a rest.
You must admire me,
spend so much time with me consuming your head.

(I can't take no more)
I think it's time for me to let it all out.
(I can't take no more)
Why my name always up in your mouth?
(What you hate me for?)
I'm so tired of all of these lies.
(I can't take no more)
No more, no more, no more, oooh

It's really been weighing on me,
i'm not myself lately.
I feel a little incomplete,
but i'm not gonna lose no sleep.
I keep it all in my mind,
cause it gotta get better in time.
Why don't you live your life?
And let me live mine.

Leave me alone, leave me alone, just leave me alone, leave me alone ...Tell the storm I'm new
I'm a wall, come and march on the regular
Painting white flags blue

Lord forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'mma rain, I'mma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose
Singin', "Freedom, freedom, where are you?"
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

I'mma wade, I'mma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Call me bulletproof

Lord forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new

I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away"
May the last one burn into flames

Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose
Singin', "Freedom, freedom, where are you?"
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
Honestly guidin' me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me
Like yeah, open correctional gates in higher desert
Yeah, open our mind as we cast away oppression
Yeah, open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads

Freedom, freedom, I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose
Singin', "Freedom, freedom, where are you?"
'Cause I need freedom too
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey, I'mma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves

And life is like a song

At last
The skies above are blue

A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Miente, lo ves
Es un juego
(Yo conosco cosas del que tu no quieres ni saber)
Sabe decir lo que
Quieres oir
Un bello embustero
(Solo por placer nuestra amistad no vamos a perder)

A mi tambien
Siempre quiere verme sola
No hay que caer
En su trampa una vez mas

Ay, no nos pelearemos
Ay, no nos va a engañar
Ay, no terminaremos
Por un bello embustero

No, nos va dividir?
No, no nos va a exitar
No, vamos a sufrir?
Por un bello embustero

Confiaba en el
Mas cuando lo que encontre
Besandote el cuello
(Pero el no lo podia creer las dos caimos en su red)
Por que a ti?
Si hay mil por ahi
El es un perro
(Las dos sin querer caimos presas en su piel)

A mi tambien
Siempre quiere verme sola
No hay que caer
En su trampa una vez mas

Ay, no nos pelearemos

Fuimos un desafio
Que pudo mas que el
Es un hombre muy frio
No es de una mujer

El no nos va separarIf I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll oudda bed in the mornin'
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it.
Cause they'd stick up for me.

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man.
I'd listen to her
Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a girl
Even just for a day
I'd get oudda bed in the mornin'
And take forever to ready.
Complain to my friends
As if they got a man. (Ohh)
They talk about you cause they jealous,
I just steady listen to it
I should get rid of them.

If I were a girl
I don't think I'd understand
How it feels to love a boy
I swear I'd be a better woman.
I'd listen to him
Cause I don't know everything.
I would always try to tell em
That he needs to treat me better
Like I don't godda change at all.
If I were a girl

It's a little too late for you to come back (No)
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that (I don't)
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong (I'm better off)

But you're just a boy
And you're just a girl
You don't understand (No)
Yeah you don't understand (Oh)
How it feels to love a girl someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
And you don't listen to him
You don't care how it hurts
You don't care how I feel
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed
But you're just a boy
And you're just a girlI was spending all my nights and days laid back daydreaming
Look at me, I'm a big girl now, said I'm gon' do something
Told the world I would paint this town, now, bitches, I run this... Ah!

'Cause I put it (down like that, put down like that)
And I'm makin' (all these racks, all these racks)
And I'm movin' (round like that, round like that)
When I do it, (I don't look back, don't look back)

I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want (But of course!)
I can be bad if I want, I can do wrong if I want
I can live fast if I want, I can go slow all night long
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want

They love the way I walk, 'cause I walk with a vengeance
And they listen to me when I talk, 'cause I ain't pretending
It took a while, now I understand just where I'm goin'
I know the world and I know who I am, it's 'bout time I show it... Ah!

'Cause I put it (down like that, put down like that)
And I'm makin' (all these racks, all these racks)

I can live fast if I want, I can go slow all night long
I'm a grown woman - I can do whatever I want

I'm a grown woman (I'm grown)
And I know that I got it (Got it, got it)
I'm a grown woman (I'm grown)
Ain't got no room in my pockets (Ah)

And flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact
You've been real distant lately
Acting like I'm not even there
He says that you
Don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right
Baby

Chorus:
If you let him take me from you

You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (baby)
If you let him take me from you

Verse 2:
Why is that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you
Dance or whatever
And your homeboy's more interested than you
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too
Baby

Chorus:
If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see


If you let him take me from you

Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (baby)
If you let him take me from you

Bridge:
Boy when i try to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
When you want some loving
Thats when its cool
But baby boy i'm not a fool

Chorus:
If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me (wanted me)
Let this happen and it proves (no no)
That your love was never true (no no)
If you let him take me from you 
(how could you let him take your woman)
If you let him take me from you

If you let him take me from you
I guess i finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves (just let me go)
That your love was never true (let me go)
If you let him take me from you (just let me kno)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from youBorn into emptiness 
Learn to be lonely 
Learn to find your way in darkness 

Who will be there for you 
Comfort and care for you 
Learn to be lonely 
Learn to be your one companion 

Never dreamed that out in the world 
There are arms to hold you 
You've always known 
Your heart was on it's own 

So laugh in your loneliness 
Child of the wilderness 
Learn to be lonely 
Learn to love life that is lived alone 

Learn to be lonely 
Learn to be your one companion 
Never dreamed that out in the world 
There are arms to hold you 
You've always known 
Your heart was on it's own 

So laugh in your loneliness 
Child of the wilderness 
Learn to be lonely 
Learn how to love life that is lived aloneBut when I look in your eyes, I feel alive...
Some days, we say words that don't mean a thing,
But when you're holding me tight, I feel alive...

Make it last forever;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me...
You and I, together;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, ooh...

Each day, I feel so blessed to be looking at you,
'Cause when you open your eyes, I feel alive...
My heart beats so damn quick when you say my name,
When I'm holding you tight, I'm so alive,
So now, let's just live it up...

Make it last forever;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me...
You and I, together;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, ooh...

Baby, last forever;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me...
You and I, together;
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me, Blue...

We gotta hold on...

You've got to hold on...
You've got a hold on, a hold onto me...

We gotta hold on...
I've gotta hold on...

Came into this world
Daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me
Oh, oh, oh
Daddy made me dance
And daddy held my hand
Oh, oh, oh
And daddy liked his whisky with his tea
And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be

He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
Oh, and that's when he gave to me

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh

Daddy made me fight
It wasn't always right
But he said girl it's your second amendment, oh, oh, oh
He always played it cool
But daddy was no fool
And right before he died he said remember

He said, "Take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister"
And that's when daddy looked at me

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

My daddy warned me about men like you
He said baby girl he's playing you
He's playing you
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said baby girl he's playing you
He's playing you
'Cause when trouble comes in town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
'Cause when trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot

Welcome to HollywoodYou feel good feeling low
I like my colours vivid
And you paint your colors gone
I like to see the world and you like your week in tone
But I've been taining behind while you refused to go

'Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight above my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

You like to sleep all day and I like my minutes
I like trips to the movies you watch TV all night long
I like to go out dancing and you go out just to hang
And I've been right beside you losing me and doing the same

'Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight above my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" sign

I looked around and baby you were gone
Where did I lost you honey
I even slow down thought you'd fall low
But you took your own roads honey
'Cause I've been traveling traveling traveling
No lead to find you
I'm making this trip alone
And I've been staying behind while you refused to go

'Cause you're such a burden
But you're the weight above my shoulders
'Cause even though I'm hurting
It still feels like it's time I'm growing
When I thought that we'd grow up and grow together the same time
Guess I passed you by at that old "Stop" sign
At that old "Stop" signI'm still in love
I never met love quite before
Until I saw your face
And watching stars without you
My soul cries
My heaving heart
Is full of pain
When we're apart
the aching
I'm kissing you
Oh
I'm kissing you oh
You're my father, you're my soldier
You protect me
Boy you saved me

See me up in the club with fifty eleven girls;
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill...
Brooklyn brim, with my eyes sittin' low,
And every boy in here with me got that smoke,
And every girl in here gotta look me up and down;
All on Instagram, cake by the pound...
Circulate the image every time I come around;
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin', babe...

Brought this all for you, just walk my way...
(Just tell me how it's looking, babe, just tell how it's looking, babe...)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim...
(And tell me how it's looking, babe...) How it's lookin', babe... (Tell me how it's lookin', babe, lookin' babe...)

Drop the bass - man, the bass get lower;
Radio say speed it up, I just go slower...
High like treble, puffin' on the mids;
No man ain't never seen a booty like this...
And why you think you keep my name rollin' up the tongue?
'Cause when you wanna smash, I just write another one...
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker;
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...

Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor...
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor...

"Beyoncé, Beyoncé?"
"Are you happy to be in Paris? Are you happy to be in Paris?"
"Beyoncé, Beyoncé? Beyoncé!"

Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up;
We ain't even gon' make it to this club...
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged;
Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck...
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse;
He Monica Lewinskied all on my gown...

Whoa there, daddy, daddy, didn't bring the towel;
Whoa baby, baby, we better slow it down...
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up,
And we ain't even gon' make it to this club...

Take all of me;

Driver, roll up the partition fast...

Driver, roll up the partition fast;
Over there, I swear I saw them cameras flash...
Handprints and footprints on my glass,
Handprints and good grips all on my ass...
Private show, with the music blasting;
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty...
Red wine drip, filth, talk that trash;
Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash...

Whoa there, daddy, daddy, now you ripped my fur;
Whoa baby, baby, be sweatin' out my hair...
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up,
And we ain't even gon' make it to this club...

Take all of me;

Take all of me;

And I see my whole future in your eyes
Thought of all my love for you

Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world
To love and to hold
To feel

Dangreously in loveOh... (Virgo...)

I wish I could look in your eyes, and tell you how I feel right now, inside;
Baby, I know that it's real (real), so real (real), so real (real), so real...

Mmm... (Miss you...)
How I wish I could be with you...
(I miss you...)
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now...

Every morning, every afternoon, every night, I wanna be with you;
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play, stay in a hotel room all day,
I just wanna be with you...
I love everything about you, from your old-school tennis shoes, 
to the way you move when you're dancing with me...

Do you remember our first kiss? It wasn't long enough...
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together? They were not long enough...
All of our conversations, all of your sweet pages, they're never long enough...

When it's time for me to leave, it's so hard to say good-bye;
I never want to say good-bye... I never ever want to say good-bye...

One day, we'll make love;
Finally, I'll be yours...
Only you, only you - I could love you...
But it's too late: I already love you...
I love you (I love you), I love you (I love you), I love you... (I love you...)That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different
From when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror
After all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

Super power
A subtle power
Super power
A tough love
Super power
Like a shark
Super power
Like a bear
A tough love

And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down

And just like you I can't be scared
And just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there
Tough love
Super power
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls
It's a super power
Super power
The laws of the world never stopped us once
Cause together we got plenty super power

Super power
A subtle power
Super power
A tough love
Super power
Like a shark
Super power
Like a bear
A tough love

And I thought the world would revolve
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Cause nothing I know can break us
Down
They can't break us down

Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us downBody bangin' up corset
Brothas wanna toss it
But they lost, cause my game made them forfeit
Slicker than a porpis and thicker than a horses
Carmen Brown got the whole town speechless
I'll stick to my thesis, I'll stick to my features
Brothas trying to hold, but thier game never reaches
Most of these cats are like the middle of peaches

I see you looking at, but what you looking at?
You in a bar, wanna twist me like a bottle cap

Mos Def  - I'm trying to holla Miss, to see if you gonna holla back

Beyonce' - Your game is whack, and know you will not get your quarter back
See this is Carmen, curves like a cul-de-sac
skin coffee and cream, your donuts, you ain't dunkin that

Mos Def  - But this is Miller, Lieutenant, if you're wondering

Sarpong  - And I'm the thag

Mos Def  - Mel Gibson

Sarpong  - Danny Gloverin'

Beyonce' - But I'm not hearing you, you might as well be mumbling
See, I have dreams with a man, what will become of him?
There's not a kid out here who can make me believe
I should post pone my goals, he got tricks up his sleeve?
Whole bar full of cuffs and you ain't locking me down

Mos Def  - I got a warrant for ya heart and a bedroom and trial

Sarpong  - Get a pardon if you come with the Sergeant, now

Beyonce' - Give me a chair, cause I don't care, I ain't feeling your style

Chorus

Mos Def  - Yo, I'm trying to get with you shorty

Beyonce' - But I'm not feeling you

Sarpong  - But I'm an officer shorty

Beyonce' - My looks are killing you


Mos Def  - Murder One will get you under the covers

Beyonce' - Game taller, man slaughter, I ain't feeling you brothas

Mos Def  - Yo, I'm trying to get with you shorty

Beyonce' - But I'm not feeling you

Sarpong  - But I'm an officer shorty

Beyonce' - My looks are killing you

Mos Def  - Murder One will get you under the covers

Beyonce' - Game taller, man slaughter, I ain't feeling you brothas

Eyes like the ocean

Mos Def  - Ma, I got some lotion
Hold ya thighs, raise 'em high and daddy long stroke you

Beyonce' - Hair like forever

Sarpong  - Swear I could do it better
Take my gun out the holster, I still got the Barretta

Beyonce' - Brothas sweat Carmen like Patrick Ewing, but that kid...

Mos Def  - Don't waste your time, he ain't no doing, he's just a Sergeant
Passing out tickets for parking

Sarpong  - Chickenheads clucking

Beyonce' - Pitiful bulls barking

See this is Carmen, voice sweet as marvin
I turn out lights, with the switch, when I'm walking
Girls getting jealous, cause they man always hawking
Even got Lou looking at me like he stalking
And I got a mind too
I wouldn't bless you, 
if your first name was "Hachu" on Sunday singing gospel

Mos Def  - You ain't a dime, just a nickel acting hostel

Beyonce' - I'm headed for the big time , I'm bouncing on this side-show...Yo, we grew up together, we cut school together
When we have kids, go through terrible two's together

Reagan:
And when they turn three we'll be watchin' the news together
Cop found slain that kind of pain last forever

Mekhi:
So what you me to be, huh?

Reagan:
A man of your family

Mekhi:
What?  Soccer dad, Saturdays, load up the Camry?

Reagan:
If I ever lost you the next would be my sanity
A house without you is not a home
It's more like Amityville

Mekhi:
Come on, Caela, you need to play fair, like vanity
You're the only woman that I speak with so candidly
You're the only woman I've been with, how can it be?
theres other fish inside the sea, but none can swim beside you, see
But becomin' a cop is like becomin a man to me

Reagan:
And if you get shot then you'll become a body bag, you see
I love more than slaves love the thought of bein' free

Mekhi:
What, you and me?

Reagan:
Simpson

Mekhi:
Ashford

Both:
Eternally

Reagan:
What about a desk job 
You still protect and servin' me
'Cause I don't wanna get that call from the infirmary
Thoughts of your surgery constantly disturbin' me

Mekhi:
But possibly a captian, your pessimism's concernin' me
You know I love you I don't have to say it verbally
wouldn't leave you in Berlin in post-war Germany

Reagn:
Somethin' just occured to me

Mekhi:
Listen, only emergencyis me and you inside the bedroom

As I hear your footsteps pace
Lock opened, doorknob turned
There appeared your face

Going outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words
You've got me!

You've got me
You've got me
You've got me
You've got me speechless

Laying so closely
I feel your skin rubbing and touching me
Only sweat between us
Feeling you kissing and pleasing me
I rub your back
I kiss your neck
I know that you love when we touch like that
I can feel you need me
Feels so good to me
Feels so good to me

Going outta my head I think I'm loosing all my mind
Drive me crazy burning candles making love all night
Feels so strange it feels so crazy to be in your world
In your arms lost for words
You've got me!

You've got me speechless

Yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes
Speechless, all I can say
Yes, yes, yes, 
All I can say is
Yes, yes, yes, yes

Kiss me
Hold me
You've got me
SpeechlessYou're my James Dean - You make me feel like I'm seventeen...
You drive too fast, you smoke too much,
But that don't mean a thing, 'cause I'm addicted to the rush...

('Cause I rather die young than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...
'Cause I rather die young (than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...

You know, I've been in love before;
You're the first one I ever seen that burns like gasoline...
So light a match, turn off the lights;
I'm holdin' on to you, 'cause this might be our last night, oh...

('Cause I rather die young than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...
'Cause I rather die young (than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...

What I'm tellin' you: I'm givin' you my life, it's in your hands,
And what I'm gonna do is be a woman, and you can be a man,
And I wanna say nobody understands what we been through;
I rather give up everything than to live my, live my life without you...

All!
All!

('Cause I rather die young than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...
'Cause I rather die young (than live my life without you;)
I rather not live at all than live my life without you...Now I'm crying and deserted, baby, but you don't care...
Can't nobody tell me this is love, when you're immune to all my pain;
I need you to tell me this is love - You don't care, well, that's okay...

Well, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la, la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...)
Oh, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la, la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...) Aow!

Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry, 
And now, every time our love goes sour, you won't sympathize...
You see these tears fallin' down to my ears - I swear, you like when I'm in pain, yeah;
I try to tell you all my fears, huh! You still don't care - that's okay...

Hey... well, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la-la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...)
Oh, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care... Yeah...
(La-la-la, la-la...) Baby... (La-la-la, la-la-la...) Aow!

Boy, maybe if you cared enough, I wouldn't have to care so much...
What happened to our trust? Now you're just givin' up;
You used to be so in love - now you don't care no more!

Well, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la,la...) Baby! (La-la-la, la-la la...)
Oh, I care!
I know you don't care too much, but I still care...
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la...) Baby! (La-la-la, la-la-la...) I still care!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...) I still care!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...) I still care!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...) Aow!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...) I still care!
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la... La-la-la, la-la-la...)Even though
Did me wrong
I always stayed
By your side
I guess
I was your fool
I always cared
There's no one
Above you
I swear
Cheated on me now
She's there

She won't answer
Your calls
Don't wanna be
Bothered at all
I guess
I'll be the one
Standing
With open arms
Sucka for love
Kisses too
Ya touch
I'm crazy for you

(Chorus:)
I'll settle for you
Yes
I will be
The one who will
Settle for you
Yes
I will be
The one you run to
You come running to
Yes
I will be
The one who will
Settle for you
Settle for you

I can never
Leave you
No matter how
Hard I try
You'll probably
Do it again
I'll still be
Right here waiting
Nothing has changed
It remains
The same
I can't explain

Sucka for love
Ya kisses too
Ya touch
I'm crazy for you

(Chorus)

Even
When the chips
Are down
I'll still
Settle for you
You'll probably
Hurt me again
I'll still
Settle for you
I know I must be
The world's
Greatest fool

I'll still
Settle for you

(Chorus)

I will always
Love you
No matter how
Hard I try
Probably
Do it again
I'll still be
Here waiting
Stuck with you
In love with you
Here for you
Loving you
Settling for you

Soon as he saw me, turned on by how the dress was fitting right;
Short and backless (backless, backless...), seein' my silhouette in the moonlight...
Such an attraction, keep telling me how my outfit's so nice;
Little did he know - ha! - my man gon' take it off tonight...

Pokin' out your back - you don't have to waste it,
Spin it all around, then take it to the ground, and...

-------------------------------------------------------------

[Hook: Beyonce]-You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

I didn't want no man
I didn't wanna fall in love, and
I didn't care about your girl
I didn't care how we would end up

But that was then, this is now
I think I'm experiencing love
I don't wanna wreck up your home
That's why I'm convinced, I gotta go

When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

Everytime she calls, you expect
Me to disappear like we never met
At first I didn't mind, but now I
Sometimes feel like you're all mine

You told me it was all about me, me
It's not about me if your still with her
Now I've realized that I've gotta move on
It might be hard, but I,
I gotta move on

When I first met you, you told me exactly how it would be
You had a lady and couldn't spend all your time with me
I only wanted to kick it, so I said 'cool, you can keep her'
Long as you satisfy me
But as the weeks went by I, I started feelin' strange
Somethin' was deep in my heart, somethin' I can't explain
I think I'm fallin' in love with you boy
I'm needing you so much, I'm cryin' just to feel your touch
I gotta leave you

I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)
I gotta leave you (gotta leave you)Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Something don't feel right
Because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secret, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this?
Going through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, and know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride?
No, they used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down they don't love you like I love you

Oh it is such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy?
Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's up
I hop up out the bed and get my swag on
I look in the mirror, say, "What's up?"
What's up, what's up, what's upOooh Oooh 
On A star 

And I'm wishing on a star 
To follow where you are 
I'm wishing on a dream 
To follow what it means 
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see 
I wish on all the people who really dream 
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes. 
And I'm wishing on our love, the things we never done 
I never thought I'd see a time when you would be 
So far away from home 
So far away from me 
Just think of all the moments that we can spend 
I just can't let you go from me, we were meant 
I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know, 
In the game of love, you reap what you sow 

I feel it's time we should make up baby 
I feel it's time for us to get together 
And make the best of things, oh baby 
When we're together 
Whether or never 
I feel it's time we should make up baby 
I feel it's time for us to get together 
And make the best of things, oh baby. 
When we're together. 
(Let's get together, baby) 
Whether or never. 

And I'm wishin on a star 
To follow where you are 
And I'm wishing on a dreamLet me take this off, while you watch me - Yes, mass appeal...
Don't take your eyes, don't take your eyes off it;
Watch it, babe...
If you like, you can touch it, baby;
(Do you?) You know you wanna touch it, baby...
Ooh... Grab ahold, don't let go, let me know that you ready;
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around...
(You rock hard, I rock steady.)

And rock right up to the side of my mountain,
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak...
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain;
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep...
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow;
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe...
And wash me over until my well runs dry;
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me...

Rocket/rock it 'til waterfalls/water falls....
Rocket 'til waterfalls...
Rock it 'til water falls...
Bathe in these waterfalls

I do it like it's my profession - I gotta make a confession:
I'm proud of all this bass - baby, I'll put it in your face...
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist,
I can be your piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer;
Anything else that you may read between the lines, you and I create...
Rockets and waterfalls...

So rock right up to the side of my mountain,
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak...
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain;
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep...
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow;
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe...
And wash me over until my well runs dry;
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me...

Hard... rock. Steady... rock. Hard... rock. Steady... rock.
Hard... rock. Steady... rock. Hard... rock. Steady...

Don't you know that I give you your loving if you need it?
I give you my word, you can believe it...
Your love feels like all four seasons 
Growing inside me - Life has a reason...
Swimming in my love, your love lifting,
Higher, harder, got me screaming to the lord, boy...
Kiss me - Pray we don't overflow, baby, I know you can feel it pulse,
Deep in the peak of my waterfall...
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, 'til the water falls... (Rockets and waterfalls...)

Damn.

I can't help but love the way we make love...

Daddy... Daddy... ooh, child. Ooh, now. 
Yes, Lord. Damn, baby.... You're driving me cray-cray...

You ain't right for doing it to me like that, Daddy,
Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl...
Tell me, what you're gon' do about that?
(Punish me, please... Punish me, please...)
Daddy, what you gon' with all of this ass, all up in your face?
Yeah, hell yeah... (Love me so deep...)
Ooh, my shit's so good, it ain't even right... I know I'm right;
Hell yeah, you the shit - that's why you're my equivalent...
So sexy...

We're so much more than pointless fixtures, Instagram pictures,
Consumers... (What about that ching-ching-ching? What about that, what about that ching-ching?)
Baby boomers... (Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...)
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in...
Home is where the heart is;
Goddammit, I'm comfortable in my skin,
And you're comfortable in my skin...
You look so comfortable in my skin, skin, skin.... (Yeah... yeah...)

But even that's a test
Constantly aware of it all
My lonely ear
Pressed against the walls of your world

Prayin' to catch you whispering

I'm prayin' to catch you whispering

Nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
When it's only in my memory
It don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern
But I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me listening
I'm prayin' to catch you whispering
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me
I'm prayin' you catch me

And I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

He's so arrogant and bold

All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?

That's real nice and all that
It's been, it been good though
Cause it's been a year
It been real good
Cause it been so good
In the summertime all over again
Tell me somethin

(Beyonce)
Out of all the guys that approach me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiousity was to me
It was the fourth day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

(Break - Beyonce - w/ ad libs)
I wanted more than just a man (man)
I needed a friend (I want a friend)
Someone I can talk to
Someone who'll really listen
When you touched my hand
The sun got brighter then
Trusting you I close my eyes
And felt our love begin

(Chorus - Beyonce)
It was the summertime (when we fell in love)
It was the summertime (when heaven shined on us)
It was the summertime (baby there is nothing like the)
Summertime, summertime

(Beyonce)
Now it's been a year and we're closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside
For me and now, you are my prize
Wanna grow old with ya
Fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you


A little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family

(Break - w/ ad libs)

(Ghostface Killah - talking behind Break)
I wanna understand everything you talk about baby
That's my word, cause I feel the same way
You know what I mean?
I've been feelin this way for a long time too
And a .. it's like I wanna be a daddy
I wanna be your lover
Your everything, I just wanna share life with you
Just like yo
That's why I tell you I love you

(Ghostface Killah)
I use to sit back and analyze on how we first met
A year ago on the barbershop steps
You and your friends walked past me
I called you back like "come here sexy have a word with you yet, please?"
Congratulations on bein my gift
God wrapped you up tight and he preserved my wish
I'm not a psychic it's just that I'm in tune with such
I swear the vibes got heavy when we got real close
My whole demeanor caused me to ask questions and stare at you strangely
Have I found my baby?
If so then tell me now
Look like you was 'bout to say somethin, you just broke a smile
Gave you the number and I said I'd dial (yeah)
A year later we on the block like "bow"
Tell me somethin, is it me or we up to somethin?
Love to love ya, your my friend and my woman

(Chorus)

(Ghostface Killah - talking)
This is Theodore, that's right
I keep hearin this all in my head over and over
I can't get it out, it's crazy
You know what I'm sayin baby
This joint is real, I like that
Tell me somethin

(Chorus)The way that I hit my damaged pride; 
You gave me away...

And I've had enough - I imagine the words I say to you...
I'm finding the strength to follow it through; 
I'm ready to change...

I'm letting go, I'm letting go!
We're only friends, we're only friends;
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls...

So let it show, so let it show...
We can't pretend, we can't pretend;
We only find ourselves by losing all
Control... 
Control...
Control...
Control...
Control... (Control...)
Control... (Control...)
Control... (Control...)
Control...

I'm opening up - Show me a sign I can't relieve...
These crazy emotions flow through me;
I'm gonna explode, oh!

You take me away from what is my ordinary life;
I won't be afraid of what we might find:
A love I can hold...

I'm letting go, I'm letting go!
We're only friends, we're only friends;
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls...

So let it show, so let it show...
We can't pretend, we can't pretend;
We only find ourselves by losing all
Control... 

Nothing ventured, nothing gained...
A new horizon ready to paint;
With every breath, you take it away...
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

I'm letting go, I'm letting go!
We're only friends, we're only friends;
Tonight we'll let the music free our souls...

So let it show, so let it show...
We can't pretend, we can't pretend;
We only find ourselves by losing all

Yo me vestiría como quiero, 
con lo que vea primero y me voy.

Saldría a buscar,
chicas por montón.
Mis amigos que son leales,
siempre van acompañarme hasta el fin,
cada noche a mentir.

Si yo fuera un chico, 
sé que podría saber,
comprender mucho mejor,
lo que es amar a una mujer.

Sabría escuchar, 
pues conozco el dolor,
de perder a quién se quiere,
porque ignoras lo que tienes,
y quedas sin saber qué pasó.

Si yo fuera un chico,
pero ves no lo soy.
Los chicos son de molde,
y nosotras somos de corazón.

Se piensan que son,
los del sexo superior.
Pero cuando lo queremos,
los vence nuestra seducción, seducción.

Si yo fuera un chico,
sé que podría saber,
comprender mucho mejor, 
lo que es amar a una mujer.

Sabría escuchar, 
pues conozco el dolor,
de perder a quién se quiere,
porque ignoras lo que tienes,
y quedas sin saber qué pasó.

Es muy tarde, ya ves, para regresar.
Perdonarte otra vez,
ya no lo vas a lograr.
El lugar que ocupabas tu,
ya no está más.

Pero eres un chico, qué le vas hacer.
No puedes comprender,
que se siente al comprender mejor,
y amar en serio a una mujer.

No sabes escuchar.
No te importa el dolor.
Hasta que pierdes a quién quieres,
porque ignoras lo que tienes,
y quedas sin saber qué pasó.

Pero eres un chico...Babe

Where my thugs at?
White T-Shirt, I love that
Timberland boots, you does that, it's a fact
That's how I like it, baby

I like the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you dress
The way you smile
I like the way you are
The way you ain't
I like your honesty, integrity,
It levels me, so please don't ever change

That's How You Like It, huh
That's How You Like It, huh
That's How You Like It, huh

Sexy way they does that (you did that)
That's how I like it, baby

I hope you like my style
The way I dress

I know you've heard I'm a gangsta
They say "Stay away from them gangstaz"
They never change up, or pull they pants up,
Well, baby girl, put ya foot down
Don't let'em push you around, you know what you like
Baby thug, you know wrong from right
You done felt grown before
This can't be what it feel like
And they don't really know whatcha feel like, for instance
They don't know the difference between real life
And the music videos & the raggedy magazines
They have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain't mad at you, it's just my Clyde
Way I wear my hat to the side
Way I lean real low when I ride
That's why my minds, they like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he come back on a Porsche
But of course
Most of all, they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty
Young Hovah & the Letter B

And it's me and you

'Cause baby, we ain't got nothin' without love
Darling, you got enough for the both of us,
So come on, baby, make love to me

When my days look low, pull me in close and don't let me go - Make love to me

Hey, I don't know much about guns, but I, I've been shot by you!

Hey, and I don't know much about fighting, but I, I know I will fight for you!
Hey, and just when I ball up my fist, I realize that I'm laying right next to you!
Baby, we ain't got nothing but love
And darling, you got enough for the both of us

When my days look low, pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me

He said I'm worth it, his one desire
(Yo conozco cosas de él que tú no quieres ni saber)
He kissed me, his one and only, (yes) beautiful Liar

A mí también, Why are we the ones who suffer?
No hay que caer, He won't be the one to cry

(Ay) Let's not kill the karma
(Ay) Let's not start a fight
(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar

No nos va dividir.
¡No! No nos va a incitar.
No vamos a sufrir,
Por un bello embustero.

 Confiaba en él mas cuando lo
encontré besándote el cuello
(I didn't know about you then 'till I saw you with him when, yeah)
¿Por qué a ti, si hay mil por ahí?, él es un perro
(you stole everything, how can you say i did you wrong?)
A mí también, when the pain and heartbreaks over
No hay que caer, the innocence is gone

¡Ay! Let's not kill the karma
¡Ay! Let's not start a fight
¡Ay! It's not work the drama
For a beautiful liar

Por un bello embustero'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth...
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through,
But I honestly can say I still love you...

Maybe we reached the mountain peak, and there's no more left to climb,
And maybe we lost the magic piece, and we're both too blind to find...

Let's start over - let's give love their wings;
Let's start over - stop fighting 'bout the same old thing...
Let's start over - we can't let our good love die;
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life...

I can see that we're not happy here,
So why would we keep pretending, when there's nothin' there?
Maybe you like it - well, I don't;
Maybe you settle - well, I won't!

Maybe we reached the mountain peak, and there's no more left to climb,
And maybe we lost that magic piece, and we're both too blind to find...

Let's start over - let's give love their wings;
Let's start over - stop fighting 'bout the same old thing...
Let's start over - we can't let our good love die;
Maybe we can start all over, give love another life...

I know that this will hurt you, I know you'll cry;
I know I called you selfish, but that's a lie...
I feel I know what's best for us;
Let's... 

Start over, and let's give love their wings;
Let's start over - I'm tired of fighting 'bout the same old thing...
Let's start over, yeah... We both know that this love won't die;
Maybe we can start all over, and give love another life...Oh la la la
Oh la la la

It slows down time
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights

You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me
Lets me know you're mine

I'd rather be with you
Because I love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way
I'd rather be with you because
You hustle hard to take care of me
I'd rather be with you
Boy I'd rather be with you

I love the way you look at me
Stare into my eyes
What do they say to you
Boy don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies
Will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you

There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when I'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothing
Saving it all for you
Baby I love making love to you
It's like a high I can't come down from you

I'd rather be with you
Because I love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what I want

I don't want nobody else
I ain't goin no where
I'm happy with you
You got me baby
I ain't thinking about
Nobody else but you babyBut you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

Solange: Don't try to tell me this ain't real
It's in the way he makes me feel
I think my baby is the one
It's in the way he holds it down

Beyoncé: I know you think that this is real
I know exactly how you feel
To young to know if he's the one
Girl you got time so slow it down

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

Solange: It's to complicated 
To explain my relationship
My friends are hating 
Cause they ain't feelin' what I'm feelin'
Leave me alone
And just let me be
Find your own thing
And get off of me

Beyoncé: It's not complicated girl
I've been where you are before
I'm not underrating
I'm just tryin' to protect your feelings
Solange listen to me understand what I'm saying
You'll realize one day
How much I care

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

Da Brat: Solange you might love the boy
Even sneak around the corner kiss and hug the boy
But Beyoncé been there before
And she wouldn't want anybody to hurt you 
Cause Matthew would drill the boy
And I can't ignore that you young
We just don't want you to get sprung
On some young dumb-dumb with no crumbs
Get all up in your heart and then run
Gettin' your heart broke is no fun
Neither is somebody telling you he not the one
You gotta learn for yourself though
And if you don't experience things 
Then you'll never know
I don't want you wishing
You coulda, shoulda, woulda did it
But you didn't
Listening to other people's advice
It's your life
Make your own decisions really

Solange: It's to complicated 
To explain my relationship
My friends are hating 
Cause they ain't feelin' what I'm feelin'
Leave me alone
And just let me be
Find your own thing
And get off of me

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me
To be strong and responsible
'Cause I think I'm in love

I know you think I'm young and naive
But you gotta trust in me

OooohYou're bad for me
I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me
Must be yo mission 
'Cause with every hug and kiss 
You're snatching every bit of strength
That I'm gon' need to fight off the inevitable 
And it's a heartbreaking situation
I'm up in but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do, 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I die

You ain't right take me high
Then that high, it subsides 
And my body flat lines
Then you come to revive 
Wait, wait, wait... I'm alive
But how long will it last 
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down?

Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I die

It's just not my body (No), it's my mind
You don't know how many times I told myself, this can't do (Can't do)
And that I don't need you (No I don't need you)
It's so unfair, (Unfair) that I find myself right back in your care (Care)
And what's good is that when you are not always there (there, there)
You're no good for my health, my health
You're just like poison (ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)
You're just like poison (ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)

Baby you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it but I do 
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Baby kiss me one more time

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system 
Breaking all of my defences with time
You're just like poison
And I just don't get it how could something so deadly, feel so right
I'm not sure of what to do 
It's a catch-22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, ooh
You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I can't lie 
Kiss me one more time before I dieBut nine times outta ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

Nine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings
But ten times out of nine, I'm only human
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Feel like that question has been posed
I'm movin' on
I'll always be committed, I been focused
I always paid attention, been devoted
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Oh, already asked that, my bad
But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, them old bitches so wack
I'm so tough, wassup?

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me would stop this love drought

You and me would stop this love droughtTo the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete
Listen
To the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release
Oh, the time has come
For my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I've followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I thought had died so long ago
Oh, I'm screaming out
And my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worse
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I've followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't
Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start but I will complete

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I've followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've got to find my own, my ownLove will see us through if only you trust in me

She don't gotta give it up, she professional
She mixing up that Ace with that Hennessy
She love the way it tastes, that's her recipe
Rushing through her veins like it's ecstasy, oh no

Oh, gonna make you feel
You always come back to me
Come back, come back
Come back, come back
Come back, come back, come backYou're the only image in my mind, so I still see you around...

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away...
Said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

The words don't ever seem to come out right, but I still mean them... Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel, but I still need to... Why is that?

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away...
I said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...
No matter who you love, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...

I miss you, like everyday;
Wanna be with you, but you're away... (But you're away...)
I said I miss you, missing you insane,
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...
No matter who you love, it is so simple:
A feeling... but it's everything...Would it change the sky tonight 
Would it give me some light 
Should I wait for you to call? 
Is there any hope at all 
Are you drifting by? 

When I think about it 
I know that I was never there or even cared 
The more I think about it 
The less that I was able to share with you 
I try to reach for you I, can almost feel you 
You're nearly here 
And then you disappear 
(Disappear, disappear, disappear) 
You disappear 
(Disappear, disappear, disappear) 

And when I lie all by myself 
I see your face, I hear your voice 
My heart stays faithful 
And time has come and time has passed 
If its good it's got to last 
It feels so right 

When I think about it 
I know that I was never there or even cared 
The more I think about it 
The less that I was able to share with you 
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you 
You're nearly here 
And then you disappear 
(Disappear, disappear, disappear) 
You disappear 
(Disappear, disappear, disappear) 
You, you disappear 

I missed all the signs 
One at a time you were ready 
What did I know starting our lives 
Now my love, I'm ready to shine 

When I think about it 
I know that I was never there or even cared 
The more I think about it 
The less that I was able to share with you 
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you 
You're nearly here 
And then you disappear 
You disappear, you disappear 
You disappear, disappearTalk your mess

Let me let me let me upgrade ya grade ya
Partna partna partna let me upgrade ya (huh...)Sorrow fills my eyes 
But I'm not strong enough to cry 
Despite of my disguise 
I'm left with no shoulder 
But everybody wants to lean on me 
I guess I'm their soldier 
Well, who's gonna be mine 

Who's there to save the hero 
When she's left all alone 
And she's crying out for help 
Who's there to save the hero 
Who's there to save the girl 
After she saves the world 
After she saves the world 

I bottle all my hurt inside 
I guess I'm living a lie 
Inside my mind each day I die 
What can bring me back to life? 
A simple word, a gesture 
Someone to say you're beautiful 
Come find this buried treasure 
Rainbows lead to a pot of gold 

Who's there to save the hero 
When she's left all alone 
And she's crying out for help 
Who's there to save the hero 
Who's there to save the girl 
After she saves the world 
After she saves the world 

I've given too much of myself 
And now it's driving me crazy 
(I'm crying out for help?) 
Sometimes I wish someone would 
Just come here and save me 
Save me from myself 

Who's there to save the hero

(If you want me you can watch me on your) Video phoneBike ride everyday on the bayou (You remember that? We were inseparable)
And I remember when you could do no wrong 
You'd come home from work and I jumped in your arms when I saw you 
I was so happy to see you (I was so excited, so happy to see you)

Because you loved me I overcome
And I'm so proud of what you've become
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understood my fears and you protected me
Treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why

I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

I still remember the expression on your face 
When you found out I'd been on a date and had a boyfriend
(My first boyfriend, you should have seen your face)
I still remember I caught you crying 'cause of my tattoo
Could have said "Beyoncé, I told you so"
Instead you said you'd get one too
(Even my mama said y'all get one just like mine)

Words can't express my boundless gratitude for you
I appreciate what you do
You've given me such security
No matter what mistakes I make you're there for me
You kill my disappointments and you heal my pain
You understand my fears and you protected me
Treasure every extraordinary memory and that's why

I want my unborn son to be like my daddy
I want my husband to be like my daddy
There is no one else like my daddy
And I thank you for loving me

Even if my man broke my heart today
No matter how much pain I'm in I will be okay
'Cause I got a man in my life that can't be replaced
For this love is unconditional, it won't go away
I know I'm lucky
Know it ain't easy
Men who take care of their responsibilities
Love is overwhelming
Can't help my tears from falling
I love you so much daddy

(Thank you, you've done so much for me. I love you, daddy.)

I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
I get so emotional daddy, every time I think of you
There is no one else like my daddy
No one else replace my daddy(Beyonce:)

I can see from the green light you ready to go
You know I slowed down once but I won't no mo'
Baby girl hold on, better buckle your seat belt
I told you to holla when he melts
I know he tried to buy your heart with a black car
Big old mansion with a big old backyard
But if he was that smart
Homeboy would already know
You're the queen of your team, the hos got to go
Shorty lets roll if you ready to ride
You've been parked to long, let me put it in drive
Ain't nothin' like thug love, and thats real
I'm a lay back, you grab the wheel
I can handle it
Get the candles lit
Got to take advantage of every chance you get
So if ya'll ain't hear me B let 'em know

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
En el closet, en un rincón
Están tus cosas, esto se acabó

Te juro que no te aguanto más
No te quiero ya ni como amante
Esta vez no ganarás
Te puedes marchar y no vuelvas jamás

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
A olvidar tu amor

Ya me curé del dolor
Ya te saqué de mi corazón
Vete con ella, solos los dos
Pobre de ti, lárgate me das asco

Tú eras mi luz
Pero hay amores que matan de daño
Me cansé de ti
Ya no soy aquella infeliz

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor

Ya no soy nada para ti
Alguien que no conoces
Lo nuestro se acabó
Tanto daño al fin lo destruyó
Nunca lloraré por ti
Porque ya me cansé de ti
No eres más imprescindible

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé, mmm
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme

No hay más que hablar, terminamos
(¿Qué sabes tú de mí?)
Este cuento al fin se ha acabado
(No me hagas reír)
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amorbut you said that you would soon be home,
But, baby, that was a long time ago...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

On top of you not calling me back,
You see, I bet you think it's all on track,
And you actin' like it's alladat...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

Let's go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
I think it's time to go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
He don't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Quite frankly: (No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it...)

It's like we at two places, but different paces;
We in trouble, but you won't meet me at the bridge...
It hurts, and feels discerning;
Did you forget where your heart lives?

What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body;
Acting like I'm not nobody - You gon' make me call somebody...
What about my body, body? What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party - somehow, somewhere, I'll be naughty...

You know I hate sleeping alone, 
but you said that you would soon be home,
But, baby, that was a long time ago...
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...)

On top of you not calling me back,

I think it's time to go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Heon't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Quite frankly: (No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it...)

(Let me show you how to get there.)
Take a left to compassion (lights will be flashin')
Keep straight and you'll see the sign right there:
Affection... (You're in the wrong direction...)
If I get caught, see, it just seems that you don't care...

What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body;
Acting like I'm not nobody - You gon' make me call somebody...
What about my body, body? What about my body, body?
You would rather go and party - somehow, somewhere, I'll be naughty...

You know I hate sleeping alone, 
but you said that you would soon be home, (You said you would soon be home...)

On top of you not calling me back,
You see, I bet you think it's all on track,
And you actin' like it's alladat... (Yo' sex ain't all that...)
(I'm not feelin' it, I'm not feelin' it...) Let's go!

Heon't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
Quite frankly: (No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it...)

I'm taking back the things I got from you, you,
And that includes my sweet little nookie too, too...

Let's go... (Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat;)
Kitty Kat. (He don't want you anymore... no...)
Uh, uh, uh...
Let's go... (Let's go, let's go little Kitty Kat;)
Kitty Kat. (He don't want you anymore... no...)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

[Rap:]
Rock diamonds on my neck, got diamonds on my records;
Since 16, I was coming down ridin' Lexus'.
How you gon' neglect this? You is just a hot mess;
You can call Tyrone - You ain't gots to lie, Craig!

What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body?
I'm in the house all alone, you rather go and party?
What about my body, body? You don't want my body, body?
Acting like I'm nobody - You gon' make me call somebody...

Let's go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
I think it's time to go... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
He ain't want no mo'... (Let's go, little kitty kat...)
No mo' getting it, I'm not feeling it.And nothing like I thought you could've been 
But still you lived inside of me 
So tell me how is that 

You're the only one I wish I could forget 
The only one I loved and not forgive 
And though you've break my heart 
You're the only one 

And though there are times when I hate you 
Cause I can't erase 
The times that you hurt me 
And put tears on my face 
And even now I hate you it pains me to say 
I know I'll be there at the end of the day 

I don't wanna be without you baby 
I don't want a broken heart 
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby 
I don't want to play that part 
I know that I love you but let me just say 
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no 
I don't want a broken heart 
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl, no no 
No broken-hearted girl 

I'm no broken-hearted girl 

There's something that I feel I need to say 
But up 'til now I've always been afraid 
That you would never come around 
And still I wanna put this out 
You say you got the most respect for me 
But sometimes I feel your not deserving of me 
And still you're in my heart 
But you're the only one 

And yes there are times when I hate you 
But I don't complain 
Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away 
Oh but now I don't hate you I'm happy to say 
That I will be there at the end of the day 

I don't wanna be without you babe 
I don't want a broken heart 
Don't wanna take a breath without you baby 
I don't want to play that part 
I know that I love you but let me just say 
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no 
I don't want a broken heart 
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl 
No, no, no broken-hearted girl 

Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh 
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, mmm yeah 
I ain't got to be afraid, my broken heart is free 
To spread my wings and fly away 
Away without you
 
Yeah yeah yeah, oh ohh... 

I don't wanna be without my baby 
I don't want a broken heart 
Don't wanna take a breath without my baby 
I don't want to play that part 
I know that I love you but let me just say 
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no no 
I don't want a broken heart 
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl 
No, no, no broken-hearted girl 
Broken-hearted girl, no, no 
No broken-hearted girl 
No broken-hearted girlKept my dick wet with his same old bet
You and your head high
And your tears dry get on without your guy

And I went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we been through
Oh,. and you tread a troubled track
Your odds are always stacked, you'll go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I know a hundred times
I go back to her
And you go back to
You go back to

I love you much
It's not enough, I love blow and you love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
I go back to blackAnd my arms are getting tired
I'm trying to beat this emptiness but I'm running out of time
I'm sinking in the sand, and I can barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

I tried to be patient, but I'm hurting deep inside
And I can't keep waiting, I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home
'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely


And I'm scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared of the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost
In this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you, I'll stretch your hand looking for mine
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

(Chorus)

I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness
I think I'm drowning
I can't be lonely
And I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely

(Chorus)That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how I like it, baby
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how I like it, baby
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how I like it, baby
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how you like it, huh?
That's how I like it, baby

I need a thug that'll have my back
Durag, Nike Airs to match
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
That's how I like it, baby
Where my thugs at?
White T-Shirt--I love that
Timberland boots--you does that; it's a fact
That's how I like it, baby

I like the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you dress
The way you smile
I like the way you are
The way you ain't
I like your honesty, integrity
It levels me, so, please, don't ever change

[Chorus]

I like the way you brush your hair
I like the stylish clothes you wear
It's just the real things you do
That's why I want to stick with you
Where my girls at?
Let them know we love that
Sexy way they does that (you did that)
That's how I like it, baby

I hope you like my style
The way I dress
The way I flirt
Say yes
I hope you like my mind
The things I say
If I'm with you, then I'm with only you
My loyalty will never, ever change

[Chorus]

I know you heard I'm a gangsta
They say stay away from them gangstas
They never change up, or pull they pants up
Well, baby girl, put ya foot down
Don't let 'em push you around: you know what you like
Baby thug, you know wrong from right
You done felt grown before--this can't be what it feel like
And they don't really know what ya feel like, for instance
They don't know the difference between real life
And the music videos and the raggedy magazines
That have it badder than he seems
All they see is my baggy jeans, my attitude
I ain't mad at you: it's just my Clyde
The way I wear my hat to the side
The way I lean real low when I ride; that's why my mind's
They like my walk
My accent from New York
My way of thinking is slightly off
They like the way he floss
Leave the block on a bike, he comes back in a Porsche
But of course
But most of all they like my honesty, integrity, my loyalty
Young 'Hov and the letter B
How you like that, huh?

[Chorus]It's a beautiful state we're in, but how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try...

We're nothing like we seem - passionate words are never spoken;
You don't know how I bleed when I leave your side...

In your eyes, love's alive;
We've come untied 'cause we're flashing by... like satellites.
Satellites...

Take all the rules away - how can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display - let's run and hide...

In our eyes, love's alive;
We've come untied 'cause we're flashing by... like satellites.
Satellites...

If we don't communicate, we'll exist in our own space...
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe...

Satellites flashing by...
Satellites...Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...
Uh-uh...

I said yes to your number, and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, we can be together, but you gotta wait for me..."
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)
I said, "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me..."
But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully;
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)

You was on the wall, I was with my crew;
You was watching me, baby, I was watching you...
Slowly, you walked over - I maintained my cool;
You said hello to me, I said hello to you...
You asked me where I'm from, I asked you what you do;
You somehow intrigued me - I thought you were so cool...
Somewhere between hi and goodbye, I felt so comfortable;
I felt like we could talk all night, so I gave my number to you...

I said yes to your number, and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, we can be together, but you gotta wait for me..."
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)
I said, "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me..."
But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully;
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)

"Certainly you can call me, baby, I love to hear from you..."
"Yes, of course, you can come and see me, boy;
Wanna get to know you more, sure, I’m feelin' you..."
"No, baby, not yet, we can’t take that next step;
Why you gettin’ so upset? Boy, you
Act as though I never told you yes before - You are so ungrateful! Mm-mm-mm..."

You was at my house, I was sittin' on my couch;
You was really buggin', so I told you to get out...
I had been misjudging you - You had a lot of nerve;
You too damn old to be so immature! I hope you learn...
You said I move too slow, I showed you to the door;
You said you'd call me later, I said, "Don't call no more..."
It is cool if you can't wait for me, I'm glad you let me know,
'Cause you showed me your true face, baby, the first time I said no...

I said yes to your number, (Yes...) and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, (Ooh...) we can be together, but you gotta (Mm-mm...) wait for me..."
The first time I say no, it's like I never said yes... (It's like I never said yes...)
(Ooh, I said yes!) I said "Yes, we can be together, yes, you can stay with me..."
(Oh...) But when I say, "No, not tonight," you actin' so ungratefully;
(The very first time I say no...) The first time I say "No," it’s like I never said "Yes..." (It's like I never said "Yes..." before...)

I said yes to your number, and yes to you dating me;
"Yes, we can be together, but you gotta wait for me..."
The first time I say "No," it’s like I never said "Yes..." (It's like I never said "Yes...")She aint yo average chick, back up.
This is for the, the, the club.
And this is for the people on the, the, the block.
When you see that girl comin, back up.
She aint yo average chick, back up.
This is for the, the, the club.
And this is for the people on the, the, the block.

She aint the average chick, she the baddest chick.
She aint the average chick, she the baddest chick.

E, e, everybody know that face.
Even with her head low, they still know that shape.
When she come through the club people take they place.
Chicks throwin handcuffs 
'cause they knowin they man aint safe.

'cause she the one switchin up flows.
If its 4 door, 2 gotta go.
Chicks like, 'what kinda jeans is those?'
And fellas watchin like, 'please get low.'

When you see that girl comin, back up.
She aint yo average chick, back up.
This is for the, the, the club.
And this is for the people on the, the, the block.
When you see that girl comin, back up.
She aint yo average chick, back up.
This is for the, the, the club.
And this is for the people on the, the, the block.

She aint the average chick, she the baddest chick.
She aint the average chick, she the baddest chick.

E, e, everybody cant do this.
Some aint gotta clue til they hear me spit.
Ah chu i spew 'cause yo girl is sick.
Is it the change or the hips you cant tell, but you know its thick.

'cause she the one switchin up flows.
If its 4 door, 2 gotta go.
Chicks like, 'what kinda jeans is those?'
And fellas watchin like, 'please get low.'

When you see that girl comin, back up.
She aint yo average chick, back up.
This is for the, the, the club.
And this is for the people on the, the, the block.
When you see that girl comin, back up.
She aint yo average chick, back up.
This is for the, the, the club.
And this is for the people on the, the, the block.

She aint the average chick, she the baddest chick.
She aint the average chick, she the baddest chick.

For this type of girl its not that hard.
You see her 'cause she's too far gone.
They only prayin, pray for her downfall.
Why they gotta be so envious?
Doin what it do fit to be a plus.

In love 
And no one could ever talk bout you 
But it sucks, so many and alabies 
I love mmmm 

Crazy feelings 
Make me stay in love wit you 
Crazy feelings 
Make me stay in love wit you 

So in love 
I just didn't see the wrong you did 
In love 
But now that I know I can admit 
It was the love that made me a fool silly fool 
In love uh, crazy feelings 

Crazy feelings 
Make me stay in love wit you 
Crazy feelings 
Make me stay in love wit you 

It was always in my face, all the time 
Even wit 20/20 vision, I couldn't see you lie 
It was always in my face, all the time 
Even wit 20/20 vision, I couldn't see you lie 

Crazy feelings 
Make me stay in love wit you 
Crazy feelings 
Make me stay in love wit you (repeat until end)I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor gets into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na

Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded

Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?", oh baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints with my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7 Eleven
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing on it
If you scared, call that reverend

Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
New sheets, he sweat it out like wash rags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic till my voice hoarse

Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerve, surfing all of this good, good

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?", oh baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love


Hold up
That D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house time back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that Third, wanna see all that shit I heard

Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off, on sight

Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"

I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights, you gon' need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breasteses is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night


We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

Never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keeping me on fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire

I've been drinking watermelon
(I want your body right here, daddy I want you, right now)
Can't keep ya eyes off my fatty
Daddy I want you

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, loveIt's so much that I could never say to your face
But by now
You should know the world and all its ways
So find your place

How do I find words that do not condescend
When she bore you before me
'Cause she doesn't need a child she needs a friend
A son, not a sob story, ooh


And your priority it must be heard

'Cause we'll never be the way we were, oh

She can't always be there just to hold you down
Our mother
When you are at a age now, well life turns around
My brother

Realize that you don't have to answer to no man
Responsibility comes down to you
But how can I expect you to understand
When you live life like it's so run-through
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo


And your priority, it must be heard

'Cause we'll never be the way we were

The way we were
We'll never be
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
At your priority, it must be her
ooh, ooh, hooI sat close to the front so I could see
Your enthusiastic demonstrations
Teaching to a class of only me
And I couldn't speak directly to you
Without stuttering or turning red
So, looking back
I don't know how I handled itHis hair was exactly the shade of brown
He's just not as tall, but I couldn't tell
It was dark and I was lying down

You are everything, he means nothing to me
I can't even remember his name
Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I came

What do you expect? You left me here alone
I drank so much and needed to touch
Don't overreact, I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely

How can I put it so you understand? 
I didn't let him hold my hand
But he looked like you
I guess he looked like you
No, he wasn't you
But you can still trust me, this ain't infidelity
It's not cheating, you were on my mind
Yes, he looked like you
But I heard love is blindI understand a man confused
They're much too big, but I don't care
I feel the weight your shoulders bear
Now I really empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you, you so frustrated
But we all become what we once hated
Besides, nobody can be that wise

I can't help you if you won't help yourself (help yourself, help yourself)
I can't help you if you don't help yourself (help yourself)
You can only get so much from someone else (You can get so much from me)
I can't help you if you won't help yourself (help yourself)

You got a degree in philosophy
So you think you cleverer than me (cause you so smart)
But I'm not just some drama queen (drama queen)
Cause it's where you're at, not where you've been
So what do you expect from me
To hold your head above the sea (keep you high and dry)
And carry you, even though you bigger
Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure
And anyway, we're still so young (yeah, I'm so young) 
And this isn't yesterday 

I can't help you if you won't help yourself, I can't help you
I can't help you if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone else
I can't help you if you won't help yourself

You might be twenty-five, but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years old most of the time
And I, I'm just a child and you full grown
And it was like nothing that I've ever known
You are like nothing that I ever knewAnd Mr Jones (Me and Mr Jones) 

What kind of fuckery is this? 
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig (oh Slick Rick) 
You thought I didn't love you when I did (when I did) 
Can't believe you played me out like that (Ahhh) 

No you ain't worth guest list 
Plus one of all them girls you kiss (all them girls) 
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (to yourself) 
Can't believe you played yourself (out) like this 

Rulers one thing but come Brixton 
Nobody stands in between me and my man 
'Cause it's me and Mr Jones (Me and Mr Jones) 

What kind of fuckery are we? 
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me (dick to me) 
I might let you make it up to me (make it up) 
Who's playing Saturday? 

What kind of fuckery are you? 
Side from Sammy you're my best black Jew 
But I could swear that we were through (we were through) 
I still want to wonder 'bout the things you do 

Mr Destiny 9 and 14 
Nobody stands in between me and my man 
'Cause it's Me and Mr JOnes (Me and Mr Jones)You need the nerd to hide your ego, don't come with that
You think everything is handed to you free
But it's not that easy, no

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

My girl says I'm too sensitive to run with you
But I'm not listening to her, mmhm
Yes, I'm perceptive, so when I'm done with you 
You'll wish your head back the way it were as you were

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

Oh, I'm not ruling you out
I'm just in doubt as to
What you say you're all about, yeah

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and then
I gotta know you now and then

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again 
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now
We may never meet againTied up enough so I don't have to wonder, 
Got so sick of crying, so just lately
When I catch myself, I do a 180

I stay up, clean the house, at least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking 
That silent sense of content that everyone gets 
Just disappears soon as the sun sets 

He is fierce in my dreams seizes my guts 
He floods me with dread 
Soaked in soul 
He swims in my eyes by the bed 
Pour myself over him 
Moon spilling in 
And I wake up alone

As far as my heart, I'd rather be restless 
The second I stop, the sleep catches up and I'm breathless 
This ache in my chest as my day is done now 
The dark covers me and I cannot run now 

My blood running cold, I stand before him 
It's all I can do to assure him 
When he comes to me, I drip for him tonight 
Drowning in me we bathe under blue light

He is fierce in my dreams seizes my guts 
He floods me with dread 
Soaked in soul 
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him 
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone 

And I wake up alone 
And I wake up alone 
And I wake up aloneI do pretty well till after sundown and suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad, 'round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight, 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
So when my heart is still with you
Yes ol' midnight knows it, too

For 'round midnight, when it comes around
So let our hearts take wings 'round midnight, 'round midnight
Let the angels sing for your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around, cause I'm feelin' sad,
And it really gets bad 'round midnight, 'round midnightLove is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is a losing game

One I wish I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand

Self professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned

Over futile odds
And laughed at by the Gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing gameHuggin' up to big monkey man

I never saw ya, I only heard of you
Huggin' up to big monkey man

It's your life, it's your life
Huggin' up to big monkey man

Now I know that now I understand
Huggin' up to big monkey man

La-la-la, la-la-la
Huggin' up to big monkey manTomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true

And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips that I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true

And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

All my loving, I will send to you

All my loving, darling I'll be true

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true

And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

All my loving, I will send to you
All my loving, darling I'll be true
All my loving, all my loving
Ooh, all my loving, I will send to youYou're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you did behave

Curtain has fallen, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait

You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end

Curtain has fallen, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait

You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you did behave

You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the endWhile you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro red

So now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah

And although my pride is not easy to disturb
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With you battered jeans and your beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me

And although he is nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to blugdeon my futile tears
And I'm not used to this, I observe, I don't chase
So now I'm stuck with consequences thrust in my face, yeah

And the melodramas of my day deliver blows
That surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be, yeah

And although my pride's not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With you battered jeans, yeah, and your beastie's tee
Now I can't work like this with you next to me

His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down I'll get it off my mind
Oh, it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks, yeah
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks

And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you get my number down and such
But I've never hated myself for my age so much, yeah

And although my pride's not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with you battered jeans, and your beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me, yeah

And although my pride's not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah, and your beastie tee


Her name is Cherry, we've just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me after eighteen years
And you still don't see me like you ought to do

Maybe we could talk 'bout things 
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to turn you down

You're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back, you stubborn as a mule

Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitarLike you did in the beginning
It's not that we grew apart
A nightingale no longer singing

It's something I know you can't do
Separate sex with emotion
I sleep alone, the sun comes up
You're still clinging to that notion

Everything is slowing down
River of no return
Recognize my every sound
There's nothing new to learn

You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night

Want the same thing when we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
A different way from where I'm going

Oh, it's you again
Listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head

Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my bed

I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did

Now it's not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night 
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right

Everything is slowing down
River of no return
You recognise my every sound 
There's nothing new to learn

You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night

Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
It's a different way from where I'm going

Oh, it's you again
Listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head

Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my ba ba dee dee bedWell babe, don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Go on, teach me tonight

Starting with the ABC of it
Right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Go on, teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me tonight

I'll use that star to write "I love you"
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love?
Graduation's almost here, my love
Oh oh teach me...
Oh oh
Teach me tonightUnsurprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we're best friends, right?
You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat when you're home at night
But we are best friends, right?

You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between

Nicky's right when he says "I can't win"
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about how you feel inside
But we are best friends, right?
I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame, blame
Now you want me to suffer just 'cause you was born wide
But we are best friends, right?

You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between

I had love for you when I was four
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla, and you get the draw

'Cause we are best friends, right, right, right, right?
'Cause we are best friends, right?
Because we are best friends, right?Whoa

Just to show him how it feels
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair

Amy, Amy, Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy, Amy, Amy
He's just too hard to ignore

Masculine, you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy, Amy, Amy
Where's my moral parallel

It takes me, half an hour to write a verse
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
My weakness for the other sex
Every time his shoulders flex
The way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track

Amy, Amy, Amy
Although I've been here before 
Amy, Amy, Amy 
He's just too hard to ignore

Masculine, he spins a spell, yeah
I think he'd wear me well
Amy, Amy, Amy
So where's my moral parallel

His own style, right down to his Diesel jeans
Immobile, I can't think by any means
Underwear peeks out the top
I'll let you know when you should stop
From the picture my mind drew
I know I'd look good on you

Amy, Amy, Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy, Amy, Amy 
You're too hard to ignore

Masculine, you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy, Amy, Amy
So where's my moral parallel

Creative energy abused
All my lyrics go unused
When I clock black hair blue eyes
I drift off, I fantasize

Amy, Amy, Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy, Amy, Amy
He's just too hard to ignore

Masculine, he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well

Where's my moral parallelIs to love, love, love him
Just to see that smile, 
makes my life worth while, 
to know, know, know him 
is to love love love him
and I do, I do, and I do

Oh I'll be good to him,
I'll bring joy to him,
oh everyone says they'll come a day 
when I'll walk along side of him

To know, know, know him
Is to love, love, love him
And I do, I really do, and I do

Why can't he see,
how blind can he be, 
someday he'll see,
that he was meant for me,
Oh, Oh, to know know know him
is to love love love him

Just to see that smile
oh it makes me life worth while
to know know know him 
is to love love love him
and I do, I really do, and I doMeet you downstairs in the bar and heard

Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt

You say, "What did you do with him today?"

And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray



'Cause you're my fella, my guy

Hand me your Stella and fly

By the time I'm out the door

You tear me down like Roger Moore



I cheated myself

Like I knew I would

I told ya I was troubled

You know that I'm no good



Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy

He's in the place, but I can't get joy

Thinking of you in the final throes

This is when my buzzer goes



Run out to meet your chips and pitter

You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter

There'll be none of him no more

I cried for you on the kitchen floor



I cheated myself

Like I knew I would

I told ya I was troubled

You know that I'm no good



Ayo, I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you

Temperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you

Let me ride with you, talk about your mistakes

You cheated yourself but these are the breaks

And it never be the same again, cause of old boy

But oh boy, together we make so much joy

In the sands and oh, what a wet, wee-wee

But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and

Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks

Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and

Act like we can rekindle that flame

It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain

He that lame, you love how I bring the pain

Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name

Say my name, that's right, I'm high post

Get the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast



I cheated myself

Like I knew I would

I told you I was trouble

You know that I'm no good



I cheated myself

Like I knew I would

I told you I was trouble

Yet you know that I'm no goodThe girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes each one she passes
Goes ..

When she walks it's just like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes
Goes ..

Ooh! how I watch her so sadly
How, I cannot tell her love her
Yeah! I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and Tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking now
When she passes,
I go...
the girl the girl the girl from Ipanema
from Ipanema ...
 
Oh, Yeah I want her so badly 
How, how can I tell her I love her
Yeah, I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walk to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

Tall and Tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes I smile but she doesn't see
She ain't looking at me
OoohSome guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Girls you know you betta watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Girls you know you betta watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thingNeed to get my thoughts down but it's getting late
Need to get up now, get my feet on the ground
But the show is so unprepared now

My place so messed up, I tried on some shoes
Should think clear and focus but I've things to do
Glancing at my CD rack, eyes linger on Frank
And I must put that check in the bank

Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I will finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Always got something to do, someone to be seeing
Somewhere to be dancing, I'm a wake human being
It's an opportunity, shout till you go blue
Unless I wanna do it, your words go through

Need to buy some cigarettes, can't put it off any longer
Worked appeal depression, I feel it growing stronger
Maybe when I'm all grown up, I will get it through
But right now I got stuff to do

Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Gotta get this song down before I leave tonight
But my hair, just does it's own thing and I gotta look alright
And I gotta write a chorus but words allude me now
I have to get this down before I leave somehow

And anyway I be thinkin' to meet you at the station
Guilty 'cause I should be home, damn procrastination
So when they ask me later, I won't tell them how it's going
But now my head is empty and the work load keeps on growing

Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio, I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work

Put me in a room, distraction less
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
Tempted to work

Distraction less
Spare me from worse
I would finally burn
Tempted to workI would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fighting for

He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow

We put it in writing
But who you writing for
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done, reciting
My stomach standing still
Like you're reading my will

He still stands in spite of what his scars say
And I'll battle till this bitter finale
Just me, my dignity and this guitar case

Yes my man is fighting some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
Who you dying for
B - I would have died too 
I'd of liked to

If my man was fighting some unholy war 
If my man was fightingPretty baby you are the soul, snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me 
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Very close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just let me get next to you

So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky, how I worry 'bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love

So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again
Baby won't you come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you 
And get a release from this awful misery

What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore
Not like before, can't you understand me
Don't you understand me, now baby please
Pull yourself together, do it very soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet

Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land 

Maybe there we can find
A good place to keep a lovin' state of mind
I'm so tired of being without it
And never knew what love was all about
James Moody would you come on hit me, 
You can blow now if you want to, I'm throughYes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time, and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab, I won't go, go, go

I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway

I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

They tried to make me go to rehab, I said: "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time, and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab, I won't go, go, go

The man said: "Why you think you're here?"
I said: "I got no idea
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near"

He said: "I just think you're depressed"
this, me, yeah, baby, and the rest

They tried to make me go to rehab, I said: "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know

I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, oooh, just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend

And It's not just my pride
It's just 'till these tears have dried

They tried to make me go to rehab, I said: "No, no, no"
Yes, I've been black, but when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time, and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
Just try to make me go to rehab, I won't go, go, goGone to find her big blue jay
Starlight, before she took flight
I sung a lullaby of bird land every night
I sung a lullaby every night
Sung for my Ava every night

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

With dread, I woke in my bed
To shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Spoke until one day she couldn't be heard
She spoke until one day she couldn't be heard
She just stopped singing

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise
She flies in paradiseMy hands were made for you
And you always give me
Stress me free point of view
Pick you up after school

 Take a token
 Of my love
 I see you through the smoke

Without you, a misery
Blue with a migraine
All the songs sound better
When you're next to me
Hey, 'cause they come naturally

 Take a token
 Of my love
 I see you through the smoke

Laying on my bed
I reach over for you
And you so fresh
You even make the standards bloom
But its just to you through

 Take a token
 Of my love
 I see you through the smoke





Waiting for the smoke to clear
I'm waiting for the smoke to clearAnd let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please, hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

I don't want to bother you, but I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all my happiness
For I love a man who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix, so

Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, if your arrow makes his love strong for me
I swear I'm gonna love him 'til eternity
I know that 'tween the both of us, his heart we can steal
Help me if you will, so

Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me
Cupid, please, hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Hey, Cupid
Oh, Cupid
Mmm, CupidI bet you wonderin'
How I knew
'Bout your plans
To make me blue
With some other guy
You knew before
Between two of us guys
You know I love you more

It took me by surprise
I must say
When I found you yesterday
Don't you know that
I heard it
Through the grapevine
Not much longer
Would you be mine
Uhh, uhh
Heard it through
The grapevine
Oh
I'm just about
To lose my mind
Honey, honey
Oh, baby
Ooh ooh honey honey
I know a man
Ain't supposed to cry
But these tears
I can't hold inside
Losin' you
Would end my life
You see
Cause you mean
That much to me
You could have
Told me yourself
That you loved
Someone else

Instead
I heard it
Through the grapevine
Not much longer
Would you be mine
Ohh
I heard it
Through the grapevine
And I'm just
About to lose my mind
Honey, honey
People say believe
Half of what you see
Oh, and none
Of what your hear
But I can't help
But be confused
If it's true
Please tell me dear
Do you plan
To let me go
For the other guy
You loved before?Says that love is blind
Still we're often told
Seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek
A certain lad
I've had in mind

Looking everywhere
Haven't found him yet
He's the big affair
I cannot forget
Only man I ever think
Of with regret

I'd like
To add his inital
To my monogram
Tell me
Where is the shepherd
For this lost lamb?

There's a somebody
I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns
Out to be
Someone to watch over me

I'm a little lamb
Who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Always be good
To one
Who'll watch over me

Although he may
Not be the man some
Girls think
Of as handsome
To my heart
He carries the key

Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over meWhen you were 15
You wore it to the disco
When everyone was in jeans

But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your low-cut dresses threw stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?

You left for London
When you were 19
Had to pawn all your nice clothes
Just living on dreams

A man in a bright light
Took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom
For a taste unknown

But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?

Hey little rich girl
You've been away for so long (oh)
And now little rich girl
I wrote you in this song (woo woh)
Hey little rich girl
Baby love has gone 
And now little rich girl
I know where you belong

At your dad's office party
All the movies were blue
You caused him so much heartache
Cos the ‘screen-star' was you

You left for London
When you were 19
Had to pull off your nice clothes
Just living on dreams

But you were just a rich girl only having fun
Your worn out dresses brought stares from everyone
Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?

Hey little rich girl: where did you go wrong?It's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones)

What kind of fuckery is this?
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig (oh Slick Rick)
And thought I didn't love you when I did (when I did)
Can't believe you played me out like that

No, you ain't worth guest list
Plus one of all them girls you kiss (all them girls)
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (to yourself)
Can't believe you played yourself like this

Rulers one thing, but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones)

What kind of fuckery are we?
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me (dick to me)
I might let you make it up to me (make it up)
Who's playing Saturday?

What kind of fuckery are you?
Side from Sammy, you're my best black Jew (best black Jew)
But I could swear that we were through (we were through)
I still wonder 'bout the things you do

Mr. Destiny, 9 and 14
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones)That her man will leave his mark on her hand
He's not all he seems
But she's seen a dress, she has the flowers planned
Now she won't be happy
Till she look down and sees the engagement ring
It's for security
But she will be waiting years for her wedding

(chorus)

For me it aint real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh 
For me it aint real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told

He won't change her life
He just chasing tail
And wasting her time
She calls herself his wife
He calls her at 8 says be here by 9
She don't notice how when she gets the ring
It's not a good fit
So next time that they row


She throws it out
It goes to the last girl he hit

(chorus)

Cuz for me it aint real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it aint real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told

So take the gold you find 
And for your own sake
Hold it in your hand
Now make sure you bite down
And watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band

(chorus)

For me it aint real
It's fools gold 
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it aint real
Yes it's fools goldMe crowd loves me
F**k Me up for this amazing situation.

How come your lonely
Come to me and you won't be
Get ready for our pipes

Your rotten and old 
I'm over you

Your a f**kin' tatter
Boring and seen

In the house
Big brother tv 'amazing'

Get ready for meAnd we'll have everything
We'll share the joy (We'll share the joy)
Falling in love can bring
No one can tell me 
That I'm too young to know (Young to know)
I love you so (Love you so)
And you love me

Our day will come (Our day will come)
If we just wait a while
No tears for us (No tears for us)
Think love and wear a smile

Our dreams have magic
Because we'll always stay in love this way
Our day will come
(Our day will come, our day will come)

Ooh...
Ooh...

Our dreams have magic
Because we'll always stay in love this way

Our day will come 
(Our day will come, our day will come)
Our day will come 
(Our day will come, our day will come)
Our day will come 
(Our day will come, our day will come)
Our day will come 
(Our day will come, our day will come)
Our day will comeAnd this regret I got accustomed to
Once it was so right when we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night

I knew I hadn't met my match but every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility you don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I don't understand, why do I stress a man
When there's so many bigger things at hand
We could've never had it all, we had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal

Even if I stop wanting you, and perspective pushes true
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play myself again, I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

So we are history, your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own

I wish I could say no regrets and no emotional debt
'Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze that only lovers see

He walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way in my blue shade
My tears dry on their own

Whoa, he walks away, the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way my deep shade
My tears dry on their own

He walks away the sun goes down
He takes the day but I'm gone
And in your way my deep shade
My tears dryTo buy his own weed and don't wear my shit down
I wouldn't care if he would give me some more
I'd rather him leave you than leave him my 'dro
When you smoke all my weed man,
You gotta call the green man
So I can get mine
And you get yours

Once is enough to make me attack
So bring me a bag and your man can come back
I'll check him at the door make sure he got green
I'm tighter than airport security teams

When you smoke all my weed man
You gotta call the green man
So I can get mine and you get yours

I'm my own man
So when will you learn
That you got a man, but I got to burn
Don't make no difference if I end up alone
I'd rather have myself a smoke my homegrown
It's got me addicted, does more than any dick did
Yeah, I can get mine and you get yours
Yeah, I can get mine and you get yoursThe lights are on, but no one's home 
She is so vacant, her soul is taken 
He thinks: "What she's running from?"

Now, how can he have her heart 
Oh when it got stole
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies (never dies, woohoo)

Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses, the man she misses
The man that he longs to be

Now, how can he have her heart 
Oh when it got stole
So he tries to pacify her 
'Cause what's inside her never dies (never dies)

So he tries to pacify her 
'Cause what's inside her, it never dies, woahoo
So he tries to pacify her 
But what's inside her never dies (da, da, da, da, wooh)But I think I was dreaming he didnt feel quite right 
I pressed his chest under my fingertips
Beside myself I sighed and reminded of his lips

I'm confused and quizical
Funny once you know
I just wan get physical 
Let me tell ya how 

Do me good I'll tell you anything you want to hear 
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good 
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear 
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good 

It's like he was designed with me in mind 
He's so good from behind
He's beautifully defined 
I miss him most of all when it got late 
Attempt to hear him breathing 
Or feel his shifting weight 

I'm confused and quizical
Funny once you know
I just wan get physical 
Let me tell ya how 

Do me good I'll tell you anything you want to hear 
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good 
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear 
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me goodI'd take a thousand thumps for my love
'Cause you kissed a lucky horseshoe
Stuck it in my boxing glove
Does anyone who will listen up
To our victories and dumb defeats
Knows they all take you to the cleaners
If you come between the cheats

1-Between the cheats
Between the cheats

My husband is the finest handsome hustler
And he still makes this housewife blush
So I go with him, my hand flicks
I'm sitting on the royal flush
Women drink him in, swim in him with green eyes
Then go home and catch the chips you've got
And here maybe two, oh, two bottles of
The jack of hearts is my jackpot

Repeat 1

'Cause we all have to lock eyes
And I know is my heartbeat
There's a winning secret to both
And it's sworn between the cheats

Repeat 1 (2x)You been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am

You always wanna talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role

Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay,
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do. Are you gay?

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

He said, 
I said, 
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script

I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than meI've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly, but darlin', can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darlin', can't you please see through me
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together

Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you

You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together

We were alone and I was singing this song for you
We were alone and I was singing this song for youSo I punched all the buzzers, hoping you wouldn't be there
And now my head's hurting, you say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there, and I'd have wanted to stay 
But I got nothing to say

You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say, man, that was ugly

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there, and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it, take the box, take the box

I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter but that's not me, you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen,I said goodbye to your bedroom
And smelled of you

Mr. False Pretense, you don't make sense, I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye? I think I love you

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Now take it, take the box
Just take it, take it take the box
And now just take the box, take the boxIt's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine?

[Chorus]
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

Play all my records, keep dancing all night
But leave me alone for a while
'Til Johnny's dancing with me,
I've got no reason to smile

[Chorus]
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you

[Instrumental Bridge]

Judy and Johnny just walked through the door
Like a queen with her king
Oh, what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring

[Chorus]
It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
You would cry too if it happened to you
[repeat and fade out]But I'm not always forward thinking
I'll tell you what you want to hear
It depends on what I've been drinking

'Cause everything I do or say
Makes it hard for you to stay
We both know, What it is

Nowadays we talk too much
Like you're forgetting all the good shit
You decide whats wrong with me
I always used to let you say
But now I like to think out loud
You're running with some different crowd
We both know, What it is

I don't know you anyomore, supposed to be the man, that I live my life by
And you're attitudes become a bore
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry, cry

Mr Ultra Sensitive
I'll never let myself forget you
Messed each other up you know
So I'm sorry if I upset you
Tomorrow is another day so I'll call you cause that's OK
We both know, What it is

I don't know you anyomore, supposed to be the man, that I live my life by, I live my life
And your attitudes become a bore
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry, I cant even cry

Relationship doesn't remain
we resonate on different flames
I could cut you down again
If you was like all other men
If you were like all other men
I know that I could shut you down again
But my friend, but my friend

I don't know you anyomore, supposed to be the man, that I live my life by, I live my life
Your attitudes become a bore
And I'm so tired, I can't even cry

I don't know you anyomore, supposed to be the man, that I live my life by
Your attitudes become a bore
And I'm so tired, I can't even cryIt's never safe for us
Not even in the evening 'cause I've been drinking
Not in the morning when your shit works
It's always dangerous when everybody's sleeping 
And I've been thinking
Can we be alone
Can we be alone

When will we get the time to be just friends
When will we get the time to be just friends

And no I'm not ashamed
But the guilt will kill you
If she don't first
I'll never love you like her

Though we need to find a time to just do this shit together
For it gets worse
I want to touch you
But that just hurts

When will we get the time to be just friends
When will we get the time to be just friends
Just friends

When will we get the time to be just friends
When will we get the time to be just friends
Just friendsOkay, Johnny Mas, you all having too much fun

Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture

Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Ah, won't you come on over
And stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Did you have to go to jail
Put your house up for sale
Did you get a good lawyer
Hope you didn't catch a tan
Hope you'll find the right man
Who'll fix it for ya

Are you shopping anywhere
Change the color of your hair
Are you busy
And did you have to pay that fine
You was dodging all the time
Are you still busy

Since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over. Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

Well, sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're
And in my head I paint a picture

Cause since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Ah, won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over, Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Mm, Valerie
Valerie
Oh, Valerie
Valerie
Why don't you come on over, ValerieRockin' your fuck me pumps
And the men notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to

'Cause you all look the same everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night 'cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer's wife

You don't like players that's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers they don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller

You're more than a fan lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night stands
He could be your whole life if you got past one night
But that part never goes right

In the morning you're vexed he's onto the next
And you didn't even get no text
Don't be too upset if they call you a sket
'Cause like the news everyday you get pressed

You don't like players that's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
Or them big ballers don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller

You can't sit down right 'cause your jeans are too tight
And you're lucky it's ladies' night
With your big empty purse every week it gets worse
At least your breasts cost more than hers

So you did Miami 'cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E, met somebody
And spent the night getting caned

Without girls like you there'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you there's no nightlife
All those men just go home to their wives

Don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump that you'd always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumpsI never wanted you to be my man
I just need your company 
Don't wanna get dependent on 
Your time or who you spent it on 
Or lose the way you love me
Like smoke
I hung around in the unbalanced

Whoa
Whoa


It's not a movie, this is not a script or proofread
I'll spit some untruths to dumb fools and groupies 
Fun to punctuate, pronunciate the funds I make ? put in your face 
Oh my mistake, you're not a floosy? Then excuse me 
Before I talk, my style introduced me
Get your name and phone number like 1-2-3 
Y'all know the story, y'all know the commentary 
I kick the narrative, this is legendary 
The good Samaritan, hood thespian
Like a polygamist, with a twist
Will I marry again? Maybe, I guess 
I hold a lady's interest, I just met 
The love scholar, she the teacher's pet
Every other eve we meet and make each other sweat 
I feel triumphant, no strings
Just a fling to have fun with
I be out in London, Camden
Huntin' for the answers, why did God take away the homie?
I can't stand it 
I'm a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
Just hope the big man show me some courtesy 
Why? 'Cause I'm deemed a heart breaker 
Like smoke, girls lean 'round a player 
Yeah, yeah


I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company 
Don't wanna get dependent on 
Your time or who you spent it on 
Or lose the way you love me
Like smoke
I hang around in the unbalanced

Whoa
Yeah
Oh, oh, whoo
Oh
Whoa
Oh, oh, oh


Yo, this recession is a test
It's affecting my complexion 
Misdirection my affection
My concerns are bill collections
The facts is the taxes, they after me 
Chapter three, my property
My handlers, they dealt with me improperly 
I say some things I should probably keep privately
Evaluate the world bank trusts like I'm IEG Those fly suites and my boojwazi 
Tall freak, she wouldn't protest with me at Wall Street
She says, no you're so deep
I said, no let's go through it
Historically so ruthless feds came for Joe Louis
She said, my man you need to laugh sometimes
Classify me as a whore, I tell her have some wine
You colder than penguin poo, in her dismay
She's thinkin' that's just so silly to say
But if you really think about it hussy 
See a penguin, he drags his shit on the ground all day
And there's a dragon ? 
I'm through with you after I crush, so is that humorous enough?
The smoke I puff
Tell the car to go to Aura, Funky Buddah, Whisky Mist on Mayfair
I hope I meet Monie Love so she can show me love
NYC to UK I might stay there
Everybody in the club tonight say, "Yeah"
You know how me and Amy are straight players


Whoa
Oh, oh, oh

I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company 
Don't wanna get dependent on 
Your time or who you spent it on 
Or lose the way you love me
Like smoke
I hang around in the unbalanced

Whoa
Oh
Ooh, oh
Hey
Oh, oh
Ooh
Oh
Whoa
Oh, oh, ohI know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need
To see me through

Sometimes it seems the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need
To see me through

When food is gone you are my daily meal, oh
When friends are gone I know my savior's love is real
Your love is real

'Cause you got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

Time after time I think "Oh Lord what's the use?"
Time after time I think it's just no good
'Cause sooner or later in life, the things you love you loose
But you got the love I need
To see me through

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love

Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
'Cause I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying "Lord I just don't care"
But you've got the love I need to see me throughSo when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place

And it overpowers me
I can't help but dance

You can try to stop me now
But you won't get the chance

Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change

Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And I swallowed it whole

You should thank your lucky stars
Cause the music is a gift
And it's stronger than all else
Provides me with the bliss

Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change

My lyrics revealing
Some natural vibe
It's a kind of laid back feeling
Oh just let it ride

And when Frank Sinatra sings
It's too much to take
So I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache

Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the changeYour rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "What did you do with him today?"
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray
'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex boy
He's in a place but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet you, chips and pita
You say "When we're married" cause you're not bitter
"There'll be none of him no more,"
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
Who truly stuck the knife in first

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yeah, you know that I'm no goodBut already she knows me better than you
She understands me
After eighteen years
And you still don't see me
Like you ought to do
Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to tune you down
You're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back
You're stubborn as a mule
Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitarRockin' your fuck me pumps
And the men notice you with your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to

'Cause you all look the same everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night 'cause your dream in life

Don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty

You should have known from the jump that you'd always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumpsHis hair was exactly the shade of brown
He's just not as tall, but I couldn't tell
It was dark and I was lying down

You are everything, he means nothing to me
I can't even remember his name
Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I came

What do you expect? You left me here alone
I drank so much and needed to touch
Don't overreact, I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely

How can I put it so you understand? 
I didn't let him hold my hand
But he looked like you
I guess he looked like you
No, he wasn't you
But you can still trust me, this ain't infidelity
It's not cheating, you were on my mind
Yes, he looked like you
But I heard love is blindYou need the nerd to hide your ego, don't come with that
You think everything is handed to you free
But it's not that easy, no

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

My girl says I'm too sensitive to run with you
But I'm not listening to her, mmhm
Yes, I'm perceptive, so when I'm done with you 
You'll wish your head back the way it were as you were

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then

Oh, I'm not ruling you out
I'm just in doubt as to
What you say you're all about, yeah

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and then
I gotta know you now and then

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again 
I gotta know you now
We may never meet again

I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now
We may never meet againPretty baby you are the soul, snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me 
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Very close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just let me get next to you

So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky, how I worry 'bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love

So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again
Baby won't you come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you 
And get a release from this awful misery

What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore
Not like before, can't you understand me
Don't you understand me, now baby please
Pull yourself together, do it very soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet

Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land 

Maybe there we can find
A good place to keep a lovin' state of mind
I'm so tired of being without it
And never knew what love was all about
James Moody would you come on hit me, 
You can blow now if you want to, I'm throughYou been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am

You always wanna talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role

Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay,
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do. Are you gay?

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

He said, 
I said, 
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script

I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than meThan what I feel for you
No sweeter song, no heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song than what you sing, sing to me

Ooh, you're the sweetest thing
That I've ever known
And to think that you are mine
You are mine alone

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for youWhile you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro red

So now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah

And although my pride is not easy to disturb
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With you battered jeans and your beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me

And although he is nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to blugdeon my futile tears
And I'm not used to this, I observe, I don't chase
So now I'm stuck with consequences thrust in my face, yeah

And the melodramas of my day deliver blows
That surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be, yeah

And although my pride's not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With you battered jeans, yeah, and your beastie's tee
Now I can't work like this with you next to me

His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down I'll get it off my mind
Oh, it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks, yeah
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks

And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you get my number down and such
But I've never hated myself for my age so much, yeah

And although my pride's not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with you battered jeans, and your beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me, yeah

And although my pride's not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah, and your beastie tee


Her name is Cherry, we've just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me after eighteen years
And you still don't see me like you ought to do

Maybe we could talk 'bout things 
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to turn you down

You're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there

I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back, you stubborn as a mule

Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitarA beautiful thing
Taking you away
My head is spinning)

My girl
Tried to stop me
But I had
A taste of you
Unfamiliar
Surroundings
Left me wanting
Something new
Physical
Ain't even my type
But you're one
Of a kind
So subconsciously
On purpose
I left my coat behind

I can't help it
Need to stop it
All that I put
Myself through
Everyone
Is so denying
Yeah
It's nice
To meet you, too

I hate
My alcoholic logic
As I write
This on the train
Victoria's Secret
In my bag
And my thighs
Ache again
Last night tips
Into my mind
Through the puddle
In my head
I always get
What I want
I think I even said

I can't help it
Need to stop it
All that I put
Myself through
Everyone
Is so denying
Yeah
It's nice
To meet you, too

Although I enjoyed it
I should have tied up
My loose ends
But I left my jacket
With you
And you know my friends
So maybe
You will get my number
Or ask them
When I'm ached down
But I may have
Forgotten you
By the next time
I'm in town

I can't help it
Need to stop it
All that I put
Myself through
Everyone
Is so denying
Yeah
It's nice
To meet you, tooYou give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure?
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
And you say that I'm the only one, the only one, yeah
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star?

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of, yeah
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me...In different ways
All the while you will see
My songs of praise
How can I concentrate
When all the while my head
Throw me scenarios
So I tease my self esteem
Though I can talk it through
Really I finally talk
My frustration is released
But nothing let em' know
And added to that I'm sick
Of having to seek some peace
Because I need emotion
With my physical release

Chorus:
Can't help
But bring it up
And beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing
I'm wasting my breath
Can't help
But bring it up
And beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing
I just keep wasting my breath

They everywhere I go
And I always stare
I justify attraction
By your hands
Your lips, your hair
And so although I always look
I know that I can't touch
And because I can only take
A full time man so much
And now I reached a point
Where I don't care anymore
It's a necessity
Just like it was before
Many says I ignore
The way my body aches
'Cause I'm the shit I earn
I can't look for my sins
Oh, oh, no

(Chorus)

Can't help
I can't help
But bring it up, no
But my
Nothing, no
Can't
I can't help, no, no
But my words are for nothing
I just keep wasting my breath

(Chorus)

Can't help
But my
Can't help
But my words are for nothing
I just keep wasting my breathKept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet

Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy

You went back to what you knew
So far removed
From all that we went through

And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...
I go back to us

I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow and I love puff

And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny
Rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

Black, black, black, black
Black, black, black
I go back to
I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to blackBut already she knows me better than you
She understands me
After eighteen years
And you still don't see me
Like you ought to do
Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to tune you down
You're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name

And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back
You're stubborn as a mule
Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitarSo surely I would never, ever go through it first hand
Emulate all the shit my mother hates
I can't help but demonstrate my Freudian fate

My alibi for taking your guy
History repeats itself, it fails to die
An animal aggression is my downfall
I don't care 'bout what you got, I want it all

It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again, 
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again, 

I'm nurturing, I just wanna do my thing
And I'll take the wrong man as naturally as I sing
And I'll save my tears for uncovering my fears
Our behavioural patterns that stick over the years

'Cause it's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again, 
Now my destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again, 
Ooh, it's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again, "What is it 'bout men? What is it 'bout men?"Than what I feel for you
No sweeter song, no heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song than what you sing, sing to me

Ooh, you're the sweetest thing
That I've ever known
And to think that you are mine
You are mine alone

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you
