Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate to pull you down into this pit

So come on
Jump in the fire

So come on
Jump in the fire
So come on
Jump in the fire

Jump by your will or be taken by force, I'll get you either way

C'mon, jump baby, nowSenseless destruction
Victims of fury are cowardly now
Running for safety
Stabbing the harlot to pay for her sins
Leaving the virgin
Suicide running as if it were free
Ripping and tearing

Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Metal militia

Chained and shadowed to be left behind
Nine and one thousand
Metal militia for your sacrifice
Iron clad soldiers
Join or be conquered the law of the land
What will befall you
The metalization of your inner soul
Twisting and turning

Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Metal militia

We are as one as we all are the same
Fighting for one cause
Leather and metal are our uniforms
Protecting what we are
Joining together to take on the world
With our heavy metal
Spreading the message to everyone here
Come let yourself go

Oh through the mist and the madness
We are trying to get the message to you

Metal militiaOnce you have seen it, you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it is heavy and dirty and mean

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know, whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once, so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others, the same song and dance

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath awayNo thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless one

War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Blood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need the feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one command

War without end

No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Only the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your face

War without end
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
No remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath

Attack
Bullets are flying
People are dying
With madness surrounding
All hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding
Bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going
Blood starts a-flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting
Swords are like lightning
It all becomes frightening
You know death is near
No remorseThe deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying death pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

The leather armies have prevailed
The phantom lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound

Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the phantom lord

Fall to your knees and bow to the phantom lordScannin' the scene in the city tonight
Lookin' for you to start up a fight
There's an evil feeling in our brains
But it is nothing new, you know it drives us insane

Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths

Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy

There is no escape and that's for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You've always been takin' but now you're giving

Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths

Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy

Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it will not go away till our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away, 'cause you're the one we will find

Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths
Running, on our way, hiding, you will pay
Dying, one thousand deaths

Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy, hahahahaBetter raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children, now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you've got some company

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds, they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen, ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeah

You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it's all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once, a sinner twice
No need for confessions now
'Cause now you've got the fight of your life

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds, they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen, ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeah

Time has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine, your body, it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence, for what you had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death, deliverance, for you, for sure
Now there's nothing you can do

So, gather 'round, young warriors, now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor, blood, guts, and sweat

The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah yeahWe do our best, you're the rest, you make it real, you know
There's a feeling deep inside that drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling of a hammerhead, you need it oh so bad

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!

Bang your head against the stage like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed, make it really sore
In a frenzied madness with your leather and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around, it's hot as hell tonight

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!

Here on the stage the Marshalls' noise is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kick your face, exploding feeling nears
Now's the time to let it rip, to let it fuckin' loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill, 'cause this is what we choose

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

Here we go!

Whiplash!

The show is through, the metal's gone, it's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig, again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways, life out here is raw
But we'll never stop, we'll never quit, 'cause we're Metallica

Adrenalin starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
